.SS About rclone
.PP
Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage.
It is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors\[aq] web storage
interfaces.
Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including S3 object
stores, business & consumer file storage services, as well as standard
transfer protocols.
.PP
Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat.
Rclone\[aq]s familiar syntax includes shell pipeline support, and
\f[C]--dry-run\f[R] protection.
It is used at the command line, in scripts or via its API.
.PP
Users call rclone \f[I]\[dq]The Swiss army knife of cloud
storage\[dq]\f[R], and \f[I]\[dq]Technology indistinguishable from
magic\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
Rclone really looks after your data.
It preserves timestamps and verifies checksums at all times.
Transfers over limited bandwidth; intermittent connections, or subject
to quota can be restarted, from the last good file transferred.
You can check (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/) the integrity
of your files.
Where possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without using
local disk.
.PP
Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply
encryption (https://rclone.org/crypt/),
compression (https://rclone.org/compress/),
chunking (https://rclone.org/chunker/),
hashing (https://rclone.org/hasher/) and
joining (https://rclone.org/union/).
.PP
Rclone mounts (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) any local,
cloud or virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows, macOS, linux and
FreeBSD, and also serves these over
SFTP (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/),
HTTP (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_http/),
WebDAV (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_webdav/),
FTP (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_ftp/) and
DLNA (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_dlna/).
.PP
Rclone is mature, open-source software originally inspired by rsync and
written in Go (https://golang.org).
The friendly support community is familiar with varied use cases.
Official Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos.
include rclone.
For the latest version downloading from
rclone.org (https://rclone.org/downloads/) is recommended.
.PP
Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac.
Third-party developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and
business process solutions using the rclone command line or API.

If mounting is wanted on macOS, either install a precompiled binary or
enable the relevant option when installing from source.
.SS macOS installation from precompiled binary, using curl
.PP
To avoid problems with macOS gatekeeper enforcing the binary to be
signed and notarized it is enough to download with \f[C]curl\f[R].
.PP
Download the latest version of rclone.

.SS macOS installation from precompiled binary, using a web browser
.PP
When downloading a binary with a web browser, the browser will set the
macOS gatekeeper quarantine attribute.
Starting from Catalina, when attempting to run \f[C]rclone\f[R], a
pop-up will appear saying:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[lq]rclone\[rq] cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The simplest fix is to run
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Install with docker
.PP
The rclone maintains a docker image for
rclone (https://hub.docker.com/r/rclone/rclone).
These images are autobuilt by docker hub from the rclone source based on
a minimal Alpine linux image.
.PP
The \f[C]:latest\f[R] tag will always point to the latest stable
release.
You can use the \f[C]:beta\f[R] tag to get the latest build from master.
You can also use version tags, e.g.
\f[C]:1.49.1\f[R], \f[C]:1.49\f[R] or \f[C]:1\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ docker pull rclone/rclone:latest

\f[R]
.fi
.PP
There are a few command line options to consider when starting an rclone
Docker container from the rclone image.
.IP \[bu] 2
You need to mount the host rclone config dir at \f[C]/config/rclone\f[R]
into the Docker container.
Due to the fact that rclone updates tokens inside its config file, and
that the update process involves a file rename, you need to mount the
whole host rclone config dir, not just the single host rclone config
file.
.IP \[bu] 2
You need to mount a host data dir at \f[C]/data\f[R] into the Docker
container.
.IP \[bu] 2
By default, the rclone binary inside a Docker container runs with UID=0
(root).
As a result, all files created in a run will have UID=0.
If your config and data files reside on the host with a non-root
UID:GID, you need to pass these on the container start command line.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you want to access the RC interface (either via the API or the Web
UI), it is required to set the \f[C]--rc-addr\f[R] to \f[C]:5572\f[R] in
order to connect to it from outside the container.
An explanation about why this is necessary is present
here (https://web.archive.org/web/20200808071950/https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-connection-refused/).
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
NOTE: Users running this container with the docker network set to
\f[C]host\f[R] should probably set it to listen to localhost only, with
\f[C]127.0.0.1:5572\f[R] as the value for \f[C]--rc-addr\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
It is possible to use \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] inside a userspace Docker
container, and expose the resulting fuse mount to the host.
The exact \f[C]docker run\f[R] options to do that might vary slightly
between hosts.
See, e.g.
the discussion in this
thread (https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/9448).
.RS 2
.PP
You also need to mount the host \f[C]/etc/passwd\f[R] and
\f[C]/etc/group\f[R] for fuse to work inside the container.
.RE
.PP
Here are some commands tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.3 host:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# config on host at \[ti]/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
# data on host at \[ti]/data

# make sure the config is ok by listing the remotes
docker run --rm \[rs]
    --volume \[ti]/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \[rs]
    --volume \[ti]/data:/data:shared \[rs]
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \[rs]
    rclone/rclone \[rs]
    listremotes

# perform mount inside Docker container, expose result to host
mkdir -p \[ti]/data/mount
docker run --rm \[rs]
    --volume \[ti]/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \[rs]
    --volume \[ti]/data:/data:shared \[rs]
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \[rs]
    --volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro --volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \[rs]
    --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \[rs]
    rclone/rclone \[rs]
    mount dropbox:Photos /data/mount &
ls \[ti]/data/mount
kill %1
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Install from source
.PP
Make sure you have at least Go (https://golang.org/) go1.15 installed.
Download go (https://golang.org/dl/) if necessary.
The latest release is recommended.
Then
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd rclone
go build
# If on macOS and mount is wanted, instead run: make GOTAGS=cmount
\&./rclone version
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will leave you a checked out version of rclone you can modify and
send pull requests with.
If you use \f[C]make\f[R] instead of \f[C]go build\f[R] then the rclone
build will have the correct version information in it.
.PP
You can also build the latest stable rclone with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go get github.com/rclone/rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or the latest version (equivalent to the beta) with
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go get github.com/rclone/rclone\[at]master
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
These will build the binary in \f[C]$(go env GOPATH)/bin\f[R]
(\f[C]\[ti]/go/bin/rclone\f[R] by default) after downloading the source
to the go module cache.
Note - do \f[B]not\f[R] use the \f[C]-u\f[R] flag here.
This causes go to try to update the dependencies that rclone uses and
sometimes these don\[aq]t work with the current version of rclone.
.SS Installation with Ansible
.PP
This can be done with Stefan Weichinger\[aq]s ansible
role (https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone).
.PP
Instructions
.IP "1." 3
\f[C]git clone https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone.git\f[R]
into your local roles-directory
.IP "2." 3
add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    - hosts: rclone-hosts
      roles:
          - rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Portable installation
.PP
As mentioned above (https://rclone.org/install/#quickstart), rclone is
single executable (\f[C]rclone\f[R], or \f[C]rclone.exe\f[R] on Windows)
that you can download as a zip archive and extract into a location of
your choosing.
When executing different commands, it may create files in different
locations, such as a configuration file and various temporary files.
By default the locations for these are according to your operating
system, e.g.
configuration file in your user profile directory and temporary files in
the standard temporary directory, but you can customize all of them,
e.g.
to make a completely self-contained, portable installation.
.PP
Run the config paths (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/)
command to see the locations that rclone will use.
.PP
To override them set the corresponding options (as command-line
arguments, or as environment
variables (https://rclone.org/docs/#environment-variables)): -
--config (https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file) -
--cache-dir (https://rclone.org/docs/#cache-dir-dir) -
--temp-dir (https://rclone.org/docs/#temp-dir-dir)
.SS Autostart
.PP
After installing and configuring rclone, as described above, you are
ready to use rclone as an interactive command line utility.
If your goal is to perform \f[I]periodic\f[R] operations, such as a
regular sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/), you will
probably want to configure your rclone command in your operating
system\[aq]s scheduler.
If you need to expose \f[I]service\f[R]-like features, such as remote
control (https://rclone.org/rc/), GUI (https://rclone.org/gui/),
serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) or
mount (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/), you will often want an
rclone command always running in the background, and configuring it to
run in a service infrastructure may be a better option.
Below are some alternatives on how to achieve this on different
operating systems.
.PP
NOTE: Before setting up autorun it is highly recommended that you have
tested your command manually from a Command Prompt first.
.SS Autostart on Windows
.PP
The most relevant alternatives for autostart on Windows are: - Run at
user log on using the Startup folder - Run at user log on, at system
startup or at schedule using Task Scheduler - Run at system startup
using Windows service
.SS Running in background
.PP
Rclone is a console application, so if not starting from an existing
Command Prompt, e.g.
when starting rclone.exe from a shortcut, it will open a Command Prompt
window.
When configuring rclone to run from task scheduler and windows service
you are able to set it to run hidden in background.
From rclone version 1.54 you can also make it run hidden from anywhere
by adding option \f[C]--no-console\f[R] (it may still flash briefly when
the program starts).
Since rclone normally writes information and any error messages to the
console, you must redirect this to a file to be able to see it.
Rclone has a built-in option \f[C]--log-file\f[R] for that.
.PP
Example command to run a sync in background:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
c:\[rs]rclone\[rs]rclone.exe sync c:\[rs]files remote:/files --no-console --log-file c:\[rs]rclone\[rs]logs\[rs]sync_files.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.SS User account
.PP
As mentioned in the mount (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/)
documentation, mounted drives created as Administrator are not visible
to other accounts, not even the account that was elevated as
Administrator.
By running the mount command as the built-in \f[C]SYSTEM\f[R] user
account, it will create drives accessible for everyone on the system.
Both scheduled task and Windows service can be used to achieve this.
.PP
NOTE: Remember that when rclone runs as the \f[C]SYSTEM\f[R] user, the
user profile that it sees will not be yours.
This means that if you normally run rclone with configuration file in
the default location, to be able to use the same configuration when
running as the system user you must explicitely tell rclone where to
find it with the
\f[C]--config\f[R] (https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file) option,
or else it will look in the system users profile path
(\f[C]C:\[rs]Windows\[rs]System32\[rs]config\[rs]systemprofile\f[R]).
To test your command manually from a Command Prompt, you can run it with
the
PsExec (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)
utility from Microsoft\[aq]s Sysinternals suite, which takes option
\f[C]-s\f[R] to execute commands as the \f[C]SYSTEM\f[R] user.
.SS Start from Startup folder
.PP
To quickly execute an rclone command you can simply create a standard
Windows Explorer shortcut for the complete rclone command you want to
run.
If you store this shortcut in the special \[dq]Startup\[dq] start-menu
folder, Windows will automatically run it at login.
To open this folder in Windows Explorer, enter path
\f[C]%APPDATA%\[rs]Microsoft\[rs]Windows\[rs]Start Menu\[rs]Programs\[rs]Startup\f[R],
or
\f[C]C:\[rs]ProgramData\[rs]Microsoft\[rs]Windows\[rs]Start Menu\[rs]Programs\[rs]StartUp\f[R]
if you want the command to start for \f[I]every\f[R] user that logs in.
.PP
This is the easiest approach to autostarting of rclone, but it offers no
functionality to set it to run as different user, or to set conditions
or actions on certain events.
Setting up a scheduled task as described below will often give you
better results.
.SS Start from Task Scheduler
.PP
Task Scheduler is an administrative tool built into Windows, and it can
be used to configure rclone to be started automatically in a highly
configurable way, e.g.
periodically on a schedule, on user log on, or at system startup.
It can run be configured to run as the current user, or for a mount
command that needs to be available to all users it can run as the
\f[C]SYSTEM\f[R] user.
For technical information, see
https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page.
.SS Run as service
.PP
For running rclone at system startup, you can create a Windows service
that executes your rclone command, as an alternative to scheduled task
configured to run at startup.
.SS Mount command built-in service integration
.PP
For mount commands, Rclone has a built-in Windows service integration
via the third-party WinFsp library it uses.
Registering as a regular Windows service easy, as you just have to
execute the built-in PowerShell command \f[C]New-Service\f[R] (requires

Example of a PowerShell command that creates a Windows service for
mounting some \f[C]remote:/files\f[R] as drive letter \f[C]X:\f[R], for

The WinFsp service
infrastructure (https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture)
supports incorporating services for file system implementations, such as
rclone, into its own launcher service, as kind of \[dq]child
services\[dq].
This has the additional advantage that it also implements a network
provider that integrates into Windows standard methods for managing
network drives.
This is currently not officially supported by Rclone, but with WinFsp
version 2019.3 B2 / v1.5B2 or later it should be possible through path
rewriting as described
here (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3340).
.SS Third-party service integration
.PP
To Windows service running any rclone command, the excellent third-party
utility NSSM (http://nssm.cc), the \[dq]Non-Sucking Service
Manager\[dq], can be used.
It includes some advanced features such as adjusting process periority,
defining process environment variables, redirect to file anything
written to stdout, and customized response to different exit codes, with
a GUI to configure everything from (although it can also be used from
command line ).
.PP
There are also several other alternatives.
To mention one more, WinSW (https://github.com/winsw/winsw),
\[dq]Windows Service Wrapper\[dq], is worth checking out.
It requires .NET Framework, but it is preinstalled on newer versions of
Windows, and it also provides alternative standalone distributions which
includes necessary runtime (.NET 5).
WinSW is a command-line only utility, where you have to manually create
an XML file with service configuration.
This may be a drawback for some, but it can also be an advantage as it
is easy to back up and re-use the configuration settings, without having
go through manual steps in a GUI.
One thing to note is that by default it does not restart the service on
error, one have to explicit enable this in the configuration file (via
the \[dq]onfailure\[dq] parameter).
.SS Autostart on Linux
.SS Start as a service
.PP
To always run rclone in background, relevant for mount commands etc, you
can use systemd to set up rclone as a system or user service.
Running as a system service ensures that it is run at startup even if
the user it is running as has no active session.
Running rclone as a user service ensures that it only starts after the
configured user has logged into the system.
.SS Run periodically from cron
.PP
To run a periodic command, such as a copy/sync, you can set up a cron
job.
.SH Usage
.PP
Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage.
After download (https://rclone.org/downloads/) and install, continue
here to learn how to use it: Initial configuration, what the basic
syntax looks like, describes the various subcommands, the various
options, and more.
.SS Configure
.PP
First, you\[aq]ll need to configure rclone.
As the object storage systems have quite complicated authentication
these are kept in a config file.
(See the \f[C]--config\f[R] entry for how to find the config file and
choose its location.)
.PP
The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:

.SS Basic syntax
.PP
Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.
.PP
Its syntax is like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Syntax: [options] subcommand <parameters> <parameters...>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, e.g.
\[dq]drive:myfolder\[dq] to look at \[dq]myfolder\[dq] in Google drive.
.PP
You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.
.PP
Please use the \f[C]-i\f[R] / \f[C]--interactive\f[R] flag while
learning rclone to avoid accidental data loss.
.SS Subcommands
.PP
rclone uses a system of subcommands.
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:path # lists a remote
rclone copy /local/path remote:path # copies /local/path to the remote
rclone sync -i /local/path remote:path # syncs /local/path to the remote
\f[R]
.fi
.SH rclone config
.PP
Enter an interactive configuration session.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Enter an interactive configuration session where you can setup new
remotes and manage existing ones.
You may also set or remove a password to protect your configuration.

.SH rclone copy
.PP
Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Copy the source to the destination.
Does not transfer files that are identical on source and destination,
testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM.
Doesn\[aq]t delete files from the destination.
.PP
Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not
the directory so when source:path is a directory, it\[aq]s the contents
of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
.PP
If dest:path doesn\[aq]t exist, it is created and the source:path
contents go there.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Let\[aq]s say there are two files in sourcepath
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sourcepath/one.txt
sourcepath/two.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This copies them to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
destpath/one.txt
destpath/two.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Not to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
destpath/sourcepath/two.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you are familiar with \f[C]rsync\f[R], rclone always works as if you
had written a trailing \f[C]/\f[R] - meaning \[dq]copy the contents of
this directory\[dq].
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.
.PP
See the --no-traverse (https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse) option for
controlling whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.
Supplying this option when copying a small number of files into a large
destination can speed transfers up greatly.
.PP
For example, if you have many files in /path/to/src but only a few of
them change every day, you can copy all the files which have changed
recently very efficiently like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/src remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: Use the \f[C]-P\f[R]/\f[C]--progress\f[R] flag to view
real-time transfer statistics.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: Use the \f[C]--dry-run\f[R] or the
\f[C]--interactive\f[R]/\f[C]-i\f[R] flag to test without copying
anything.

.PP
Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only.
Doesn\[aq]t transfer files that are identical on source and destination,
testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM.
Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if
necessary (except duplicate objects, see below).
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R]: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
\f[C]--dry-run\f[R] or the \f[C]--interactive\f[R]/\f[C]-i\f[R] flag.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that files in the destination won\[aq]t be deleted if there were
any errors at any point.
Duplicate objects (files with the same name, on those providers that
support it) are also not yet handled.
.PP
It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it\[aq]s the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.
See extended explanation in the \f[C]copy\f[R] command above if unsure.
.PP
If dest:path doesn\[aq]t exist, it is created and the source:path
contents go there.
.PP

.SH rclone move
.PP
Move files from source to dest.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.
Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and the remote
does not support a server-side directory move operation.
.PP
If no filters are in use and if possible this will server-side move
\f[C]source:path\f[R] into \f[C]dest:path\f[R].
After this \f[C]source:path\f[R] will no longer exist.
.PP
Otherwise for each file in \f[C]source:path\f[R] selected by the filters
(if any) this will move it into \f[C]dest:path\f[R].
If possible a server-side move will be used, otherwise it will copy it
(server-side if possible) into \f[C]dest:path\f[R] then delete the
original (if no errors on copy) in \f[C]source:path\f[R].
.PP
If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the
--delete-empty-src-dirs flag.
.PP
See the --no-traverse (https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse) option for
controlling whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.

.SH rclone delete
.PP
Remove the files in path.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Remove the files in path.
Unlike \f[C]purge\f[R] it obeys include/exclude filters so can be used
to selectively delete files.
.PP
\f[C]rclone delete\f[R] only deletes files but leaves the directory
structure alone.
If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents use the
\f[C]purge\f[R] command.
.PP
If you supply the \f[C]--rmdirs\f[R] flag, it will remove all empty
directories along with it.
You can also use the separate command \f[C]rmdir\f[R] or
\f[C]rmdirs\f[R] to delete empty directories only.
.PP
For example, to delete all files bigger than 100 MiB, you may first want
to check what would be deleted (use either):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then proceed with the actual delete:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
That reads \[dq]delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MiB\[dq],
hence delete all files bigger than 100 MiB.
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R]: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the

.PP
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
It compares sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files
that don\[aq]t match.
It doesn\[aq]t alter the source or destination.
.PP
If you supply the \f[C]--size-only\f[R] flag, it will only compare the
sizes not the hashes as well.
Use this for a quick check.
.PP
If you supply the \f[C]--download\f[R] flag, it will download the data
from both remotes and check them against each other on the fly.
This can be useful for remotes that don\[aq]t support hashes or if you
really want to check all the data.
.PP
If you supply the \f[C]--checkfile HASH\f[R] flag with a valid hash
name, the \f[C]source:path\f[R] must point to a text file in the SUM
format.
.PP
If you supply the \f[C]--one-way\f[R] flag, it will only check that
files in the source match the files in the destination, not the other
way around.
This means that extra files in the destination that are not in the
source will not be detected.
.PP
The \f[C]--differ\f[R], \f[C]--missing-on-dst\f[R],
\f[C]--missing-on-src\f[R], \f[C]--match\f[R] and \f[C]--error\f[R]
flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is
\f[C]-\f[R]) supplied.
What they write is described in the help below.
For example \f[C]--differ\f[R] will write all paths which are present on
both the source and destination but different.
.PP
The \f[C]--combined\f[R] flag will write a file (or stdout) which
contains all file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path
to tell you what happened to it.
These are reminiscent of diff files.

.SH rclone dedupe
.PP
Interactively find duplicate filenames and delete/rename them.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
By default \f[C]dedupe\f[R] interactively finds files with duplicate
names and offers to delete all but one or rename them to be different.
This is known as deduping by name.
.PP
Deduping by name is only useful with a small group of backends (e.g.
Google Drive, Opendrive) that can have duplicate file names.
It can be run on wrapping backends (e.g.
crypt) if they wrap a backend which supports duplicate file names.
.PP
However if --by-hash is passed in then dedupe will find files with
duplicate hashes instead which will work on any backend which supports
at least one hash.
This can be used to find files with duplicate content.
This is known as deduping by hash.
.PP
If deduping by name, first rclone will merge directories with the same
name.
It will do this iteratively until all the identically named directories
have been merged.
.PP
Next, if deduping by name, for every group of duplicate file names /
hashes, it will delete all but one identical file it finds without
confirmation.
This means that for most duplicated files the \f[C]dedupe\f[R] command
will not be interactive.
.PP
\f[C]dedupe\f[R] considers files to be identical if they have the same
file path and the same hash.
If the backend does not support hashes (e.g.
crypt wrapping Google Drive) then they will never be found to be
identical.
If you use the \f[C]--size-only\f[R] flag then files will be considered
identical if they have the same size (any hash will be ignored).
This can be useful on crypt backends which do not support hashes.
.PP
Next rclone will resolve the remaining duplicates.
Exactly which action is taken depends on the dedupe mode.
By default, rclone will interactively query the user for each one.
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R]: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
\f[C]--dry-run\f[R] or the \f[C]--interactive\f[R]/\f[C]-i\f[R] flag.

.SS Synopsis
.PP
Perform bidirectonal synchronization between two paths.
.PP
Bisync (https://rclone.org/bisync/) provides a bidirectional cloud sync
solution in rclone.
It retains the Path1 and Path2 filesystem listings from the prior run.
On each successive run it will: - list files on Path1 and Path2, and
check for changes on each side.
Changes include \f[C]New\f[R], \f[C]Newer\f[R], \f[C]Older\f[R], and
\f[C]Deleted\f[R] files.
- Propagate changes on Path1 to Path2, and vice-versa.

.SH rclone checksum
.PP
Checks the files in the source against a SUM file.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Checks that hashsums of source files match the SUM file.
It compares hashes (MD5, SHA1, etc) and logs a report of files which
don\[aq]t match.
It doesn\[aq]t alter the file system.
.PP
If you supply the \f[C]--download\f[R] flag, it will download the data
from remote and calculate the contents hash on the fly.
This can be useful for remotes that don\[aq]t support hashes or if you
really want to check all the data.
.PP
Note that hash values in the SUM file are treated as case insensitive.
.PP
If you supply the \f[C]--one-way\f[R] flag, it will only check that
files in the source match the files in the destination, not the other
way around.
This means that extra files in the destination that are not in the
source will not be detected.
.PP
The \f[C]--differ\f[R], \f[C]--missing-on-dst\f[R],
\f[C]--missing-on-src\f[R], \f[C]--match\f[R] and \f[C]--error\f[R]
flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is
\f[C]-\f[R]) supplied.
What they write is described in the help below.
For example \f[C]--differ\f[R] will write all paths which are present on
both the source and destination but different.
.PP
The \f[C]--combined\f[R] flag will write a file (or stdout) which
contains all file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path
to tell you what happened to it.
These are reminiscent of diff files.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]= path\f[R] means path was found in source and destination and was
identical
.IP \[bu] 2
\[ga]- path\[ga] means path was missing on the source, so only in the

.SH rclone config create
.PP
Create a new remote with name, type and options.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Create a new remote of \f[C]name\f[R] with \f[C]type\f[R] and options.
The options should be passed in pairs of \f[C]key\f[R] \f[C]value\f[R]
or as \f[C]key=value\f[R].
.PP
For example, to make a swift remote of name myremote using auto config
you would do:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config create myremote swift env_auth true
rclone config create myremote swift env_auth=true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
So for example if you wanted to configure a Google Drive remote but
using remote authorization you would do this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config create mydrive drive config_is_local=false
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the
default is taken (unless \f[C]--non-interactive\f[R] is used).
Each time that happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how
to affect the value taken.
.PP
If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will
automatically obscure them if they aren\[aq]t already obscured before
putting them in the config file.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and
consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about
whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured
passwords into the config file.
If you want to be 100% certain that the passwords get obscured then use
the \f[C]--obscure\f[R] flag, or if you are 100% certain you are already
passing obscured passwords then use \f[C]--no-obscure\f[R].
You can also set obscured passwords using the
\f[C]rclone config password\f[R] command.
.PP
The flag \f[C]--non-interactive\f[R] is for use by applications that
wish to configure rclone themeselves, rather than using rclone\[aq]s
text based configuration questions.
If this flag is set, and rclone needs to ask the user a question, a JSON
blob will be returned with the question in it.
.PP
This will look something like (some irrelevant detail removed):

.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]Type\f[R] - type of value, eg \f[C]bool\f[R], \f[C]string\f[R],

.PP
At the end of the non interactive process, rclone will return a result
with \f[C]State\f[R] as empty string.

.SH rclone config update
.PP
Update options in an existing remote.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Update an existing remote\[aq]s options.
The options should be passed in pairs of \f[C]key\f[R] \f[C]value\f[R]
or as \f[C]key=value\f[R].
.PP
For example, to update the env_auth field of a remote of name myremote
you would do:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config update myremote env_auth true
rclone config update myremote env_auth=true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If the remote uses OAuth the token will be updated, if you don\[aq]t
require this add an extra parameter thus:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config update myremote env_auth=true config_refresh_token=false
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the
default is taken (unless \f[C]--non-interactive\f[R] is used).
Each time that happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how
to affect the value taken.
.PP
If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will
automatically obscure them if they aren\[aq]t already obscured before
putting them in the config file.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and
consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about
whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured
passwords into the config file.
If you want to be 100% certain that the passwords get obscured then use
the \f[C]--obscure\f[R] flag, or if you are 100% certain you are already
passing obscured passwords then use \f[C]--no-obscure\f[R].
You can also set obscured passwords using the
\f[C]rclone config password\f[R] command.
.PP
The flag \f[C]--non-interactive\f[R] is for use by applications that
wish to configure rclone themeselves, rather than using rclone\[aq]s
text based configuration questions.
If this flag is set, and rclone needs to ask the user a question, a JSON
blob will be returned with the question in it.
.PP
This will look something like (some irrelevant detail removed):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.PP
The format of \f[C]Option\f[R] is the same as returned by
\f[C]rclone config providers\f[R].
The question should be asked to the user and returned to rclone as the
\f[C]--result\f[R] option along with the \f[C]--state\f[R] parameter.

.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]Help\f[R] - help text.

.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]Required\f[R] - the value should be non-empty
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]IsPassword\f[R] - the value is a password and should be edited as
such
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]Type\f[R] - type of value, eg \f[C]bool\f[R], \f[C]string\f[R],
\f[C]int\f[R] and others
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]Exclusive\f[R] - if set no free-form entry allowed only the
\f[C]Examples\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2

\f[C]NoPrefix\f[R], \f[C]Advanced\f[R]
.PP
If \f[C]Error\f[R] is set then it should be shown to the user at the
same time as the question.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config update name --continue --state \[dq]*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,,\[dq] --result \[dq]true\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that when using \f[C]--continue\f[R] all passwords should be passed
in the clear (not obscured).
Any default config values should be passed in with each invocation of
\f[C]--continue\f[R].
.PP
At the end of the non interactive process, rclone will return a result
with \f[C]State\f[R] as empty string.
.PP
If \f[C]--all\f[R] is passed then rclone will ask all the config
questions, not just the post config questions.
Any parameters are used as defaults for questions as usual.

.SH rclone cryptcheck
.PP
Cryptcheck checks the integrity of a crypted remote.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone cryptcheck checks a remote against a crypted remote.
This is the equivalent of running rclone check, but able to check the
checksums of the crypted remote.
.PP
For it to work the underlying remote of the cryptedremote must support
some kind of checksum.
.PP
It works by reading the nonce from each file on the cryptedremote: and
using that to encrypt each file on the remote:.
It then checks the checksum of the underlying file on the cryptedremote:
against the checksum of the file it has just encrypted.
.PP
Use it like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone cryptcheck /path/to/files encryptedremote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can use it like this also, but that will involve downloading all the
files in remote:path.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone cryptcheck remote:path encryptedremote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
After it has run it will log the status of the encryptedremote:.
.PP
If you supply the \f[C]--one-way\f[R] flag, it will only check that
files in the source match the files in the destination, not the other
way around.
This means that extra files in the destination that are not in the
source will not be detected.
.PP
The \f[C]--differ\f[R], \f[C]--missing-on-dst\f[R],
\f[C]--missing-on-src\f[R], \f[C]--match\f[R] and \f[C]--error\f[R]
flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or stdout if it is
\f[C]-\f[R]) supplied.
What they write is described in the help below.
For example \f[C]--differ\f[R] will write all paths which are present on
both the source and destination but different.
.PP
The \f[C]--combined\f[R] flag will write a file (or stdout) which
contains all file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path
to tell you what happened to it.
These are reminiscent of diff files.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]= path\f[R] means path was found in source and destination and was
identical
.IP \[bu] 2
\[ga]- path\[ga] means path was missing on the source, so only in the

.IP \[bu] 2
\[ga]+ path\[ga] means path was missing on the destination, so only in

.SH rclone hashsum
.PP
Produces a hashsum file for all the objects in the path.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
Produces a hash file for all the objects in the path using the hash
named.
The output is in the same format as the standard md5sum/sha1sum tool.
.PP
By default, the hash is requested from the remote.
If the hash is not supported by the remote, no hash will be returned.
With the download flag, the file will be downloaded from the remote and
hashed locally enabling any hash for any remote.
.PP
This command can also hash data received on standard input (stdin), by
not passing a remote:path, or by passing a hyphen as remote:path when
there is data to read (if not, the hypen will be treated literaly, as a
relative path).
.PP
Run without a hash to see the list of all supported hashes, e.g.
.IP

.SH rclone lsf
.PP
List directories and objects in remote:path formatted for parsing.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
List the contents of the source path (directories and objects) to
standard output in a form which is easy to parse by scripts.
By default this will just be the names of the objects and directories,
one per line.
The directories will have a / suffix.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone lsf swift:bucket
bevajer5jef
canole
diwogej7
ferejej3gux/
fubuwic
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Use the --format option to control what gets listed.
By default this is just the path, but you can use these parameters to
control the output:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
p - path
s - size
t - modification time
h - hash
i - ID of object
o - Original ID of underlying object
m - MimeType of object if known
e - encrypted name
T - tier of storage if known, e.g. \[dq]Hot\[dq] or \[dq]Cool\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
So if you wanted the path, size and modification time, you would use
--format \[dq]pst\[dq], or maybe --format \[dq]tsp\[dq] to put the path
last.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone lsf  --format \[dq]tsp\[dq] swift:bucket

2016-06-25 18:55:40;37600;fubuwic
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you specify \[dq]h\[dq] in the format you will get the MD5 hash by
default, use the \[dq]--hash\[dq] flag to change which hash you want.
Note that this can be returned as an empty string if it isn\[aq]t
available on the object (and for directories), \[dq]ERROR\[dq] if there
was an error reading it from the object and \[dq]UNSUPPORTED\[dq] if
that object does not support that hash type.
.PP
For example, to emulate the md5sum command you can use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator \[dq]  \[dq] --files-only .
\f[R]

(Though \[dq]rclone md5sum .\[dq] is an easier way of typing this.)
.PP
By default the separator is \[dq];\[dq] this can be changed with the
--separator flag.

is a good strategy.

However on bucket based backends (like s3, gcs, b2, azureblob etc) if
the item isn\[aq]t found it will return an empty directory as it
isn\[aq]t possible to tell empty directories from missing directories
there.
.PP
The Path field will only show folders below the remote path being
listed.
If \[dq]remote:path\[dq] contains the file \[dq]subfolder/file.txt\[dq],
the Path for \[dq]file.txt\[dq] will be \[dq]subfolder/file.txt\[dq],

The time is in RFC3339 format with up to nanosecond precision.
The number of decimal digits in the seconds will depend on the precision
that the remote can hold the times, so if times are accurate to the

.SH rclone mount
.PP
Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to mount any of
Rclone\[aq]s cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.
.PP
First set up your remote using \f[C]rclone config\f[R].
Check it works with \f[C]rclone ls\f[R] etc.
.PP
On Linux and macOS, you can run mount in either foreground or background
(aka daemon) mode.
Mount runs in foreground mode by default.
Use the \f[C]--daemon\f[R] flag to force background mode.
On Windows you can run mount in foreground only, the flag is ignored.
.PP
In background mode rclone acts as a generic Unix mount program: the main
program starts, spawns background rclone process to setup and maintain
the mount, waits until success or timeout and exits with appropriate
code (killing the child process if it fails).
.PP
On Linux/macOS/FreeBSD start the mount like this, where
\f[C]/path/to/local/mount\f[R] is an \f[B]empty\f[R] \f[B]existing\f[R]
directory:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
On Windows you can start a mount in different ways.
See below for details.
If foreground mount is used interactively from a console window, rclone
will serve the mount and occupy the console so another window should be
used to work with the mount until rclone is interrupted e.g.
by pressing Ctrl-C.
.PP
The following examples will mount to an automatically assigned drive, to
specific drive letter \f[C]X:\f[R], to path
\f[C]C:\[rs]path\[rs]parent\[rs]mount\f[R] (where parent directory or
drive must exist, and mount must \f[B]not\f[R] exist, and is not
supported when mounting as a network drive), and the last example will
mount as network share \f[C]\[rs]\[rs]cloud\[rs]remote\f[R] and map it
to an automatically assigned drive:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\[rs]path\[rs]parent\[rs]mount
rclone mount remote:path/to/files \[rs]\[rs]cloud\[rs]remote
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or
receiving a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount should be automatically
stopped.
.PP
When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount
manually:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# Linux
fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
# OS X
umount /path/to/local/mount
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user\[aq]s responsibility to stop the mount
manually.
.PP
The size of the mounted file system will be set according to information
retrieved from the remote, the same as returned by the rclone
about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/) command.
Remotes with unlimited storage may report the used size only, then an
additional 1 PiB of free space is assumed.
If the remote does not
support (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) the about
feature at all, then 1 PiB is set as both the total and the free size.
.SS Installing on Windows
.PP
To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to download and install
WinFsp (http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/).
.PP
WinFsp (https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp) is an open-source Windows File
System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file systems for
Windows.
It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone uses combination with
cgofuse (https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse).
Both of these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful
during the implementation of rclone mount for Windows.
.SS Mounting modes on windows
.PP
Unlike other operating systems, Microsoft Windows provides a different
filesystem type for network and fixed drives.
It optimises access on the assumption fixed disk drives are fast and
reliable, while network drives have relatively high latency and less
reliability.
Some settings can also be differentiated between the two types, for
example that Windows Explorer should just display icons and not create
preview thumbnails for image and video files on network drives.
.PP
In most cases, rclone will mount the remote as a normal, fixed disk
drive by default.
However, you can also choose to mount it as a remote network drive,
often described as a network share.
If you mount an rclone remote using the default, fixed drive mode and
experience unexpected program errors, freezes or other issues, consider
mounting as a network drive instead.
.PP
When mounting as a fixed disk drive you can either mount to an unused
drive letter, or to a path representing a \f[B]non-existent\f[R]
subdirectory of an \f[B]existing\f[R] parent directory or drive.
Using the special value \f[C]*\f[R] will tell rclone to automatically
assign the next available drive letter, starting with Z: and moving
backward.
Examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\[rs]path\[rs]parent\[rs]mount
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Option \f[C]--volname\f[R] can be used to set a custom volume name for
the mounted file system.
The default is to use the remote name and path.
.PP
To mount as network drive, you can add option \f[C]--network-mode\f[R]
to your mount command.
Mounting to a directory path is not supported in this mode, it is a
limitation Windows imposes on junctions, so the remote must always be
mounted to a drive letter.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
A volume name specified with \f[C]--volname\f[R] will be used to create
the network share path.
A complete UNC path, such as \f[C]\[rs]\[rs]cloud\[rs]remote\f[R],
optionally with path
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]cloud\[rs]remote\[rs]madeup\[rs]path\f[R], will be used
as is.
Any other string will be used as the share part, after a default prefix
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]server\[rs]\f[R].
If no volume name is specified then \f[C]\[rs]\[rs]server\[rs]share\f[R]
will be used.
You must make sure the volume name is unique when you are mounting more
than one drive, or else the mount command will fail.
The share name will treated as the volume label for the mapped drive,
shown in Windows Explorer etc, while the complete
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]server\[rs]share\f[R] will be reported as the remote UNC
path by \f[C]net use\f[R] etc, just like a normal network drive mapping.
.PP
If you specify a full network share UNC path with \f[C]--volname\f[R],
this will implicitely set the \f[C]--network-mode\f[R] option, so the
following two examples have same result:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode
rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --volname \[rs]\[rs]server\[rs]share
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You may also specify the network share UNC path as the mountpoint
itself.
Then rclone will automatically assign a drive letter, same as with
\f[C]*\f[R] and use that as mountpoint, and instead use the UNC path
specified as the volume name, as if it were specified with the
\f[C]--volname\f[R] option.
This will also implicitely set the \f[C]--network-mode\f[R] option.
This means the following two examples have same result:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount remote:path/to/files \[rs]\[rs]cloud\[rs]remote
rclone mount remote:path/to/files * --volname \[rs]\[rs]cloud\[rs]remote
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
There is yet another way to enable network mode, and to set the share
path, and that is to pass the \[dq]native\[dq] libfuse/WinFsp option
directly: \f[C]--fuse-flag --VolumePrefix=\[rs]server\[rs]share\f[R].
Note that the path must be with just a single backslash prefix in this
case.
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] In previous versions of rclone this was the only
supported method.

mapping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_mapping)
.PP
See also Limitations section below.
.SS Windows filesystem permissions
.PP
The FUSE emulation layer on Windows must convert between the POSIX-based
permission model used in FUSE, and the permission model used in Windows,
based on access-control lists (ACL).
.PP
The mounted filesystem will normally get three entries in its
access-control list (ACL), representing permissions for the POSIX
permission scopes: Owner, group and others.
By default, the owner and group will be taken from the current user, and
the built-in group \[dq]Everyone\[dq] will be used to represent others.
The user/group can be customized with FUSE options \[dq]UserName\[dq]
and \[dq]GroupName\[dq], e.g.
\f[C]-o UserName=user123 -o GroupName=\[dq]Authenticated Users\[dq]\f[R].
The permissions on each entry will be set according to options
\f[C]--dir-perms\f[R] and \f[C]--file-perms\f[R], which takes a value in
traditional numeric
notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions#Numeric_notation).
.PP
The default permissions corresponds to
\f[C]--file-perms 0666 --dir-perms 0777\f[R], i.e.
read and write permissions to everyone.
This means you will not be able to start any programs from the the
mount.
To be able to do that you must add execute permissions, e.g.
\f[C]--file-perms 0777 --dir-perms 0777\f[R] to add it to everyone.
If the program needs to write files, chances are you will have to enable
VFS File Caching as well (see also limitations).
.PP
Note that the mapping of permissions is not always trivial, and the
result you see in Windows Explorer may not be exactly like you expected.
For example, when setting a value that includes write access, this will
be mapped to individual permissions \[dq]write attributes\[dq],
\[dq]write data\[dq] and \[dq]append data\[dq], but not \[dq]write
extended attributes\[dq].
Windows will then show this as basic permission \[dq]Special\[dq]
instead of \[dq]Write\[dq], because \[dq]Write\[dq] includes the
\[dq]write extended attributes\[dq] permission.
.PP
If you set POSIX permissions for only allowing access to the owner,
using \f[C]--file-perms 0600 --dir-perms 0700\f[R], the user group and
the built-in \[dq]Everyone\[dq] group will still be given some special
permissions, such as \[dq]read attributes\[dq] and \[dq]read
permissions\[dq], in Windows.
This is done for compatibility reasons, e.g.
to allow users without additional permissions to be able to read basic
metadata about files like in UNIX.
One case that may arise is that other programs (incorrectly) interprets
this as the file being accessible by everyone.
For example an SSH client may warn about \[dq]unprotected private key
file\[dq].
.PP
WinFsp 2021 (version 1.9) introduces a new FUSE option
\[dq]FileSecurity\[dq], that allows the complete specification of file
security descriptors using
SDDL (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-string-format).
With this you can work around issues such as the mentioned
\[dq]unprotected private key file\[dq] by specifying
\f[C]-o FileSecurity=\[dq]D:P(A;;FA;;;OW)\[dq]\f[R], for file all access
(FA) to the owner (OW).
.SS Windows caveats
.PP
Drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts, not
even an account that was elevated to Administrator with the User Account
Control (UAC) feature.
A result of this is that if you mount to a drive letter from a Command
Prompt run as Administrator, and then try to access the same drive from
Windows Explorer (which does not run as Administrator), you will not be
able to see the mounted drive.
.PP
If you don\[aq]t need to access the drive from applications running with
administrative privileges, the easiest way around this is to always
create the mount from a non-elevated command prompt.
.PP
To make mapped drives available to the user account that created them
regardless if elevated or not, there is a special Windows setting called
linked
connections (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/mapped-drives-not-available-from-elevated-command#detail-to-configure-the-enablelinkedconnections-registry-entry)
that can be enabled.
.PP
It is also possible to make a drive mount available to everyone on the
system, by running the process creating it as the built-in SYSTEM
account.
There are several ways to do this: One is to use the command-line
utility
PsExec (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec),
from Microsoft\[aq]s Sysinternals suite, which has option \f[C]-s\f[R]
to start processes as the SYSTEM account.
Another alternative is to run the mount command from a Windows Scheduled
Task, or a Windows Service, configured to run as the SYSTEM account.
A third alternative is to use the WinFsp.Launcher
infrastructure (https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture)).
Note that when running rclone as another user, it will not use the
configuration file from your profile unless you tell it to with the
\f[C]--config\f[R] (https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file) option.
Read more in the install documentation (https://rclone.org/install/).
.PP
Note that mapping to a directory path, instead of a drive letter, does
not suffer from the same limitations.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Without the use of \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] this can only write files
sequentially, it can only seek when reading.
This means that many applications won\[aq]t work with their files on an
rclone mount without \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode writes\f[R] or
\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode full\f[R].
See the VFS File Caching section for more info.
.PP
The bucket-based remotes (e.g.
Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2, Hubic) do not support the concept
of empty directories, so empty directories will have a tendency to
disappear once they fall out of the directory cache.
.PP
When \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] is invoked on Unix with \f[C]--daemon\f[R]
flag, the main rclone program will wait for the background mount to
become ready or until the timeout specified by the
\f[C]--daemon-wait\f[R] flag.
On Linux it can check mount status using ProcFS so the flag in fact sets
\f[B]maximum\f[R] time to wait, while the real wait can be less.
On macOS / BSD the time to wait is constant and the check is performed
only at the end.
We advise you to set wait time on macOS reasonably.
.PP
Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.
.SS rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy
.PP
File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable.
The rclone sync/copy commands cope with this with lots of retries.
However rclone mount can\[aq]t use retries in the same way without
making local copies of the uploads.
Look at the VFS File Caching for solutions to make mount more reliable.
.SS Attribute caching
.PP
You can use the flag \f[C]--attr-timeout\f[R] to set the time the kernel
caches the attributes (size, modification time, etc.) for directory
entries.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1s\f[R] which caches files just long enough to avoid
too many callbacks to rclone from the kernel.
.PP
In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can
change outside the control of the kernel.
However this causes quite a few problems such as rclone using too much
memory (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2157), rclone not
serving files to
samba (https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-39-vs-1-40-mount-issue/5112)
and excessive time listing
directories (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2095#issuecomment-371141147).
.PP
The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by
\f[C]--attr-timeout\f[R].
You may see corruption if the remote file changes length during this
window.
It will show up as either a truncated file or a file with garbage on the
end.
With \f[C]--attr-timeout 1s\f[R] this is very unlikely but not
impossible.
The higher you set \f[C]--attr-timeout\f[R] the more likely it is.
The default setting of \[dq]1s\[dq] is the lowest setting which
mitigates the problems above.
.PP
If you set it higher (\f[C]10s\f[R] or \f[C]1m\f[R] say) then the kernel
will call back to rclone less often making it more efficient, however
there is more chance of the corruption issue above.
.PP
If files don\[aq]t change on the remote outside of the control of rclone
then there is no chance of corruption.
.PP
This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.
.SS Filters
.PP
Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.
.SS systemd
.PP
When running rclone mount as a systemd service, it is possible to use
Type=notify.
In this case the service will enter the started state after the
mountpoint has been successfully set up.
Units having the rclone mount service specified as a requirement will
see all files and folders immediately in this mode.
.PP
Note that systemd runs mount units without any environment variables
including \f[C]PATH\f[R] or \f[C]HOME\f[R].
This means that tilde (\f[C]\[ti]\f[R]) expansion will not work and you
should provide \f[C]--config\f[R] and \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R] explicitly
as absolute paths via rclone arguments.
Since mounting requires the \f[C]fusermount\f[R] program, rclone will
use the fallback PATH of \f[C]/bin:/usr/bin\f[R] in this scenario.
Please ensure that \f[C]fusermount\f[R] is present on this PATH.
.SS Rclone as Unix mount helper
.PP
The core Unix program \f[C]/bin/mount\f[R] normally takes the
\f[C]-t FSTYPE\f[R] argument then runs the \f[C]/sbin/mount.FSTYPE\f[R]
helper program passing it mount options as \f[C]-o key=val,...\f[R] or
\f[C]--opt=...\f[R].
Automount (classic or systemd) behaves in a similar way.
.PP
rclone by default expects GNU-style flags \f[C]--key val\f[R].
To run it as a mount helper you should symlink rclone binary to
\f[C]/sbin/mount.rclone\f[R] and optionally \f[C]/usr/bin/rclonefs\f[R],
e.g.
\f[C]ln -s /usr/bin/rclone /sbin/mount.rclone\f[R].
rclone will detect it and translate command-line arguments
appropriately.
.PP
Now you can run classic mounts like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mount sftp1:subdir /mnt/data -t rclone -o vfs_cache_mode=writes,sftp_key_file=/path/to/pem
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or create systemd mount units:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.mount
[Unit]
After=network-online.target
[Mount]
Type=rclone
What=sftp1:subdir
Where=/mnt/data
Options=rw,allow_other,args2env,vfs-cache-mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache-dir=/var/rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
optionally accompanied by systemd automount unit
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.automount
[Unit]
After=network-online.target
Before=remote-fs.target
[Automount]
Where=/mnt/data
TimeoutIdleSec=600
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or add in \f[C]/etc/fstab\f[R] a line like
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sftp1:subdir /mnt/data rclone rw,noauto,nofail,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone 0 0
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or use classic Automountd.
Remember to provide explicit \f[C]config=...,cache-dir=...\f[R] as a
workaround for mount units being run without \f[C]HOME\f[R].
.PP
Rclone in the mount helper mode will split \f[C]-o\f[R] argument(s) by
comma, replace \f[C]_\f[R] by \f[C]-\f[R] and prepend \f[C]--\f[R] to
get the command-line flags.
Options containing commas or spaces can be wrapped in single or double
quotes.
Any inner quotes inside outer quotes of the same type should be doubled.
.PP
Mount option syntax includes a few extra options treated specially:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]env.NAME=VALUE\f[R] will set an environment variable for the mount
process.
This helps with Automountd and Systemd.mount which don\[aq]t allow
setting custom environment for mount helpers.
Typically you will use \f[C]env.HTTPS_PROXY=proxy.host:3128\f[R] or
\f[C]env.HOME=/root\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]command=cmount\f[R] can be used to run \f[C]cmount\f[R] or any
other rclone command rather than the default \f[C]mount\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]args2env\f[R] will pass mount options to the mount helper running
in background via environment variables instead of command line
arguments.
This allows to hide secrets from such commands as \f[C]ps\f[R] or
\f[C]pgrep\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]vv...\f[R] will be transformed into appropriate
\f[C]--verbose=N\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
standard mount options like \f[C]x-systemd.automount\f[R],
\f[C]_netdev\f[R], \f[C]nosuid\f[R] and alike are intended only for
Automountd and ignored by rclone.
.SS VFS - Virtual File System
.PP
This command uses the VFS layer.
This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something
which looks much more like a disk filing system.
.PP
Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren\[aq]t like disk
files - you can\[aq]t extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that.
Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various
options explained below.
.PP
The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.
.SS VFS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]--dir-cache-time\f[R] flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the
polling interval.
.PP
You can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one open file and won\[aq]t be shared.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
.PP
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]--buffer-size * open files\f[R].
.SS VFS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a
normal file system.
It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.
.PP
For example you\[aq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven\[aq]t been accessed for \f[C]--vfs-write-back\f[R]
seconds.
If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven\[aq]t been uploaded,
these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.
.PP
If using \f[C]--vfs-cache-max-size\f[R] note that the cache may exceed
this size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\f[C]--vfs-cache-poll-interval\f[R].
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.PP
You \f[B]should not\f[R] run two copies of rclone using the same VFS
cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using
\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode > off\f[R].
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do.
You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy
with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R].
You don\[aq]t need to worry about this if the remotes in use don\[aq]t
overlap.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode off
.PP
In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[aq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[dq]off\[dq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disk.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.
.PP
In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.
.PP
So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file.
These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they
will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present
in them.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] writes.
.PP
When reading a file rclone will read \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] plus
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] bytes ahead.
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is buffered in memory whereas the
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is buffered on disk.
.PP
When using this mode it is recommended that \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is
not set too large and \f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is set large if
required.
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT\f[R] not all file systems support sparse files.
In particular FAT/exFAT do not.
Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem
which doesn\[aq]t support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message
if one is detected.
.SS VFS Chunked Reading
.PP
When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks.
This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an
increased number of requests.
.PP
These flags control the chunking:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will start reading a chunk of size
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], and then double the size for each read.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit\f[R] is specified, and greater
than \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], the chunk size for each open file
will get doubled only until the specified value is reached.
If the value is \[dq]off\[dq], which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.
.PP
With \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M\f[R] and
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0\f[R] the following parts will be
downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M\f[R] is specified, the result
would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so
on.
.PP
Setting \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R] to \f[C]0\f[R] or \[dq]off\[dq]
disables chunked reading.
.SS VFS Performance
.PP
These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons.
See also the chunked reading feature.
.PP
In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the
\f[C]--no-modtime\f[R] flag (or use \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R] for a
slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a
transaction.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--no-checksum     Don\[aq]t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don\[aq]t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don\[aq]t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order.
Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence
read or write to come in.
These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When using VFS write caching (\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] with value
writes or full), the global flag \f[C]--transfers\f[R] can be set to
adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache
(the related global flag \f[C]--checkers\f[R] has no effect on the VFS).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not
the default.
.PP
The \f[C]--vfs-case-insensitive\f[R] VFS flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[dq]false\[dq], rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is.
If the flag is \[dq]true\[dq] (or appears without a value on the command
line), rclone may perform a \[dq]fixup\[dq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
the underlying remote.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[dq]fixup\[dq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[dq]true\[dq] on
Windows and macOS, \[dq]false\[dq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[dq]true\[dq].
.SS Alternate report of used bytes
.PP
Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running \f[C]df\f[R]
on the filesystem, then pass the flag \f[C]--vfs-used-is-size\f[R] to
rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to
\f[C]rclone size\f[R] and compute the total used space itself.
.PP
\f[I]WARNING.\f[R] Contrary to \f[C]rclone size\f[R], this flag ignores
filters so that the result is accurate.
However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls
resulting in extra charges.
Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

If the remote file already exists, it will be overwritten.
.PP
rcat will try to upload small files in a single request, which is
usually more efficient than the streaming/chunked upload endpoints,
which use multiple requests.
Exact behaviour depends on the remote.
What is considered a small file may be set through
\f[C]--streaming-upload-cutoff\f[R].
Uploading only starts after the cutoff is reached or if the file ends
before that.
The data must fit into RAM.
The cutoff needs to be small enough to adhere the limits of your remote,
please see there.
Generally speaking, setting this cutoff too high will decrease your
performance.
.PP
Use the |--size| flag to preallocate the file in advance at the remote
end and actually stream it, even if remote backend doesn\[aq]t support
streaming.
.PP
|--size| should be the exact size of the input stream in bytes.
If the size of the stream is different in length to the |--size| passed
in then the transfer will likely fail.
.PP
Note that the upload can also not be retried because the data is not
kept around until the upload succeeds.
If you need to transfer a lot of data, you\[aq]re better off caching
locally and then \f[C]rclone move\f[R] it to the destination.

Remove empty directories under the path.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
This recursively removes any empty directories (including directories
that only contain empty directories), that it finds under the path.
The root path itself will also be removed if it is empty, unless you
supply the \f[C]--leave-root\f[R] flag.
.PP
Use command \f[C]rmdir\f[R] to delete just the empty directory given by

This is useful for tidying up remotes that rclone has left a lot of

.SH rclone selfupdate
.PP
Update the rclone binary.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
This command downloads the latest release of rclone and replaces the
currently running binary.
The download is verified with a hashsum and cryptographically signed
signature.
.PP
If used without flags (or with implied \f[C]--stable\f[R] flag), this
command will install the latest stable release.
However, some issues may be fixed (or features added) only in the latest
beta release.
In such cases you should run the command with the \f[C]--beta\f[R] flag,
i.e.
\f[C]rclone selfupdate --beta\f[R].
You can check in advance what version would be installed by adding the
\f[C]--check\f[R] flag, then repeat the command without it when you are
satisfied.
.PP
Sometimes the rclone team may recommend you a concrete beta or stable
rclone release to troubleshoot your issue or add a bleeding edge
feature.
The \f[C]--version VER\f[R] flag, if given, will update to the concrete
version instead of the latest one.
If you omit micro version from \f[C]VER\f[R] (for example
\f[C]1.53\f[R]), the latest matching micro version will be used.
.PP
Upon successful update rclone will print a message that contains a
previous version number.
You will need it if you later decide to revert your update for some
reason.
Then you\[aq]ll have to note the previous version and run the following
command: \f[C]rclone selfupdate [--beta] OLDVER\f[R].
If the old version contains only dots and digits (for example
\f[C]v1.54.0\f[R]) then it\[aq]s a stable release so you won\[aq]t need
the \f[C]--beta\f[R] flag.
Beta releases have an additional information similar to
\f[C]v1.54.0-beta.5111.06f1c0c61\f[R].
(if you are a developer and use a locally built rclone, the version
number will end with \f[C]-DEV\f[R], you will have to rebuild it as it
obviously can\[aq]t be distributed).
.PP
If you previously installed rclone via a package manager, the package
may include local documentation or configure services.
You may wish to update with the flag \f[C]--package deb\f[R] or
\f[C]--package rpm\f[R] (whichever is correct for your OS) to update
these too.
This command with the default \f[C]--package zip\f[R] will update only
the rclone executable so the local manual may become inaccurate after
it.
.PP
The \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] command
(https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) may or may not support
extended FUSE options depending on the build and OS.
\f[C]selfupdate\f[R] will refuse to update if the capability would be
discarded.
.PP
Note: Windows forbids deletion of a currently running executable so this
command will rename the old executable to \[aq]rclone.old.exe\[aq] upon
success.
.PP
Please note that this command was not available before rclone version
1.55.
If it fails for you with the message
\f[C]unknown command \[dq]selfupdate\[dq]\f[R] then you will need to

.PP
Serve remote:path over DLNA
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve dlna is a DLNA media server for media stored in an rclone
remote.
Many devices, such as the Xbox and PlayStation, can automatically
discover this server in the LAN and play audio/video from it.
VLC is also supported.
Service discovery uses UDP multicast packets (SSDP) and will thus only
work on LANs.
.PP
Rclone will list all files present in the remote, without filtering
based on media formats or file extensions.
Additionally, there is no media transcoding support.
This means that some players might show files that they are not able to
play back correctly.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \f[C]--addr\f[R] to specify which IP address and port the server
should listen on, e.g.
\f[C]--addr 1.2.3.4:8000\f[R] or \f[C]--addr :8080\f[R] to listen to all
IPs.
.PP
Use \f[C]--name\f[R] to choose the friendly server name, which is by
default \[dq]rclone (hostname)\[dq].
.PP
Use \f[C]--log-trace\f[R] in conjunction with \f[C]-vv\f[R] to enable
additional debug logging of all UPNP traffic.
.SS VFS - Virtual File System
.PP
This command uses the VFS layer.
This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something
which looks much more like a disk filing system.
.PP
Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren\[aq]t like disk
files - you can\[aq]t extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that.
Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various
options explained below.
.PP
The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.
.SS VFS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]--dir-cache-time\f[R] flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the
polling interval.
.PP
You can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one open file and won\[aq]t be shared.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
.PP
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]--buffer-size * open files\f[R].
.SS VFS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a
normal file system.
It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.
.PP
For example you\[aq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven\[aq]t been accessed for \f[C]--vfs-write-back\f[R]
seconds.
If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven\[aq]t been uploaded,
these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.
.PP
If using \f[C]--vfs-cache-max-size\f[R] note that the cache may exceed
this size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\f[C]--vfs-cache-poll-interval\f[R].
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.PP
You \f[B]should not\f[R] run two copies of rclone using the same VFS
cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using
\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode > off\f[R].
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do.
You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy
with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R].
You don\[aq]t need to worry about this if the remotes in use don\[aq]t
overlap.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode off
.PP
In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[aq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[dq]off\[dq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disk.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.
.PP
In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.
.PP
So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file.
These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they
will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present
in them.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] writes.
.PP
When reading a file rclone will read \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] plus
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] bytes ahead.
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is buffered in memory whereas the
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is buffered on disk.
.PP
When using this mode it is recommended that \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is
not set too large and \f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is set large if
required.
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT\f[R] not all file systems support sparse files.
In particular FAT/exFAT do not.
Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem
which doesn\[aq]t support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message
if one is detected.
.SS VFS Chunked Reading
.PP
When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks.
This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an
increased number of requests.
.PP
These flags control the chunking:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will start reading a chunk of size
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], and then double the size for each read.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit\f[R] is specified, and greater
than \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], the chunk size for each open file
will get doubled only until the specified value is reached.
If the value is \[dq]off\[dq], which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.
.PP
With \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M\f[R] and
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0\f[R] the following parts will be
downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M\f[R] is specified, the result
would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so
on.
.PP
Setting \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R] to \f[C]0\f[R] or \[dq]off\[dq]
disables chunked reading.
.SS VFS Performance
.PP
These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons.
See also the chunked reading feature.
.PP
In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the
\f[C]--no-modtime\f[R] flag (or use \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R] for a
slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a
transaction.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--no-checksum     Don\[aq]t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don\[aq]t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don\[aq]t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order.
Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence
read or write to come in.
These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When using VFS write caching (\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] with value
writes or full), the global flag \f[C]--transfers\f[R] can be set to
adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache
(the related global flag \f[C]--checkers\f[R] has no effect on the VFS).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not
the default.
.PP
The \f[C]--vfs-case-insensitive\f[R] VFS flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[dq]false\[dq], rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is.
If the flag is \[dq]true\[dq] (or appears without a value on the command
line), rclone may perform a \[dq]fixup\[dq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
the underlying remote.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[dq]fixup\[dq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[dq]true\[dq] on
Windows and macOS, \[dq]false\[dq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[dq]true\[dq].
.SS Alternate report of used bytes
.PP
Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running \f[C]df\f[R]
on the filesystem, then pass the flag \f[C]--vfs-used-is-size\f[R] to
rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to
\f[C]rclone size\f[R] and compute the total used space itself.
.PP
\f[I]WARNING.\f[R] Contrary to \f[C]rclone size\f[R], this flag ignores
filters so that the result is accurate.
However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls
resulting in extra charges.
Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

.IP \[bu] 2
rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) - Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve docker
.PP
Serve any remote on docker\[aq]s volume plugin API.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
This command implements the Docker volume plugin API allowing docker to
use rclone as a data storage mechanism for various cloud providers.
rclone provides docker volume plugin based on it.
.PP
To create a docker plugin, one must create a Unix or TCP socket that
Docker will look for when you use the plugin and then it listens for
commands from docker daemon and runs the corresponding code when
necessary.
Docker plugins can run as a managed plugin under control of the docker
daemon or as an independent native service.
For testing, you can just run it directly from the command line, for
example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo rclone serve docker --base-dir /tmp/rclone-volumes --socket-addr localhost:8787 -vv
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Running \f[C]rclone serve docker\f[R] will create the said socket,
listening for commands from Docker to create the necessary Volumes.
Normally you need not give the \f[C]--socket-addr\f[R] flag.
The API will listen on the unix domain socket at
\f[C]/run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock\f[R].
In the example above rclone will create a TCP socket and a small file
\f[C]/etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec\f[R] containing the socket address.
We use \f[C]sudo\f[R] because both paths are writeable only by the root
user.
.PP
If you later decide to change listening socket, the docker daemon must
be restarted to reconnect to \f[C]/run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock\f[R]
or parse new \f[C]/etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec\f[R].
Until you restart, any volume related docker commands will timeout
trying to access the old socket.
Running directly is supported on \f[B]Linux only\f[R], not on Windows or
MacOS.
This is not a problem with managed plugin mode described in details in
the full documentation (https://rclone.org/docker).
.PP
The command will create volume mounts under the path given by
\f[C]--base-dir\f[R] (by default
\f[C]/var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone\f[R] available only to root) and
maintain the JSON formatted file \f[C]docker-plugin.state\f[R] in the
rclone cache directory with book-keeping records of created and mounted
volumes.
.PP
All mount and VFS options are submitted by the docker daemon via API,
but you can also provide defaults on the command line as well as set
path to the config file and cache directory or adjust logging verbosity.
.SS VFS - Virtual File System
.PP
This command uses the VFS layer.
This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something
which looks much more like a disk filing system.
.PP
Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren\[aq]t like disk
files - you can\[aq]t extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that.
Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various
options explained below.
.PP
The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.
.SS VFS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]--dir-cache-time\f[R] flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the
polling interval.
.PP
You can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one open file and won\[aq]t be shared.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
.PP
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]--buffer-size * open files\f[R].
.SS VFS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a
normal file system.
It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.
.PP
For example you\[aq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven\[aq]t been accessed for \f[C]--vfs-write-back\f[R]
seconds.
If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven\[aq]t been uploaded,
these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.
.PP
If using \f[C]--vfs-cache-max-size\f[R] note that the cache may exceed
this size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\f[C]--vfs-cache-poll-interval\f[R].
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.PP
You \f[B]should not\f[R] run two copies of rclone using the same VFS
cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using
\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode > off\f[R].
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do.
You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy
with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R].
You don\[aq]t need to worry about this if the remotes in use don\[aq]t
overlap.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode off
.PP
In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[aq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[dq]off\[dq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disk.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.
.PP
In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.
.PP
So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file.
These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they
will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present
in them.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] writes.
.PP
When reading a file rclone will read \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] plus
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] bytes ahead.
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is buffered in memory whereas the
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is buffered on disk.
.PP
When using this mode it is recommended that \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is
not set too large and \f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is set large if
required.
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT\f[R] not all file systems support sparse files.
In particular FAT/exFAT do not.
Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem
which doesn\[aq]t support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message
if one is detected.
.SS VFS Chunked Reading
.PP
When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks.
This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an
increased number of requests.
.PP
These flags control the chunking:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will start reading a chunk of size
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], and then double the size for each read.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit\f[R] is specified, and greater
than \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], the chunk size for each open file
will get doubled only until the specified value is reached.
If the value is \[dq]off\[dq], which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.
.PP
With \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M\f[R] and
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0\f[R] the following parts will be
downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M\f[R] is specified, the result
would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so
on.
.PP
Setting \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R] to \f[C]0\f[R] or \[dq]off\[dq]
disables chunked reading.
.SS VFS Performance
.PP
These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons.
See also the chunked reading feature.
.PP
In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the
\f[C]--no-modtime\f[R] flag (or use \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R] for a
slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a
transaction.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--no-checksum     Don\[aq]t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don\[aq]t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don\[aq]t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order.
Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence
read or write to come in.
These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When using VFS write caching (\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] with value
writes or full), the global flag \f[C]--transfers\f[R] can be set to
adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache
(the related global flag \f[C]--checkers\f[R] has no effect on the VFS).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not
the default.
.PP
The \f[C]--vfs-case-insensitive\f[R] VFS flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[dq]false\[dq], rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is.
If the flag is \[dq]true\[dq] (or appears without a value on the command
line), rclone may perform a \[dq]fixup\[dq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
the underlying remote.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[dq]fixup\[dq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[dq]true\[dq] on
Windows and macOS, \[dq]false\[dq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[dq]true\[dq].
.SS Alternate report of used bytes
.PP
Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running \f[C]df\f[R]
on the filesystem, then pass the flag \f[C]--vfs-used-is-size\f[R] to
rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to
\f[C]rclone size\f[R] and compute the total used space itself.
.PP
\f[I]WARNING.\f[R] Contrary to \f[C]rclone size\f[R], this flag ignores
filters so that the result is accurate.
However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls
resulting in extra charges.
Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) - Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve ftp
.PP
Serve remote:path over FTP.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve ftp implements a basic ftp server to serve the remote over
FTP protocol.
This can be viewed with a ftp client or you can make a remote of type
ftp to read and write it.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, e.g.
--addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.
.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can set a single username and password with the --user and --pass
flags.
.SS VFS - Virtual File System
.PP
This command uses the VFS layer.
This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something
which looks much more like a disk filing system.
.PP
Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren\[aq]t like disk
files - you can\[aq]t extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that.
Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various
options explained below.
.PP
The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.
.SS VFS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]--dir-cache-time\f[R] flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the
polling interval.
.PP
You can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one open file and won\[aq]t be shared.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
.PP
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]--buffer-size * open files\f[R].
.SS VFS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a
normal file system.
It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.
.PP
For example you\[aq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven\[aq]t been accessed for \f[C]--vfs-write-back\f[R]
seconds.
If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven\[aq]t been uploaded,
these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.
.PP
If using \f[C]--vfs-cache-max-size\f[R] note that the cache may exceed
this size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\f[C]--vfs-cache-poll-interval\f[R].
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.PP
You \f[B]should not\f[R] run two copies of rclone using the same VFS
cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using
\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode > off\f[R].
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do.
You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy
with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R].
You don\[aq]t need to worry about this if the remotes in use don\[aq]t
overlap.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode off
.PP
In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[aq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[dq]off\[dq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disk.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.
.PP
In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.
.PP
So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file.
These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they
will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present
in them.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] writes.
.PP
When reading a file rclone will read \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] plus
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] bytes ahead.
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is buffered in memory whereas the
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is buffered on disk.
.PP
When using this mode it is recommended that \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is
not set too large and \f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is set large if
required.
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT\f[R] not all file systems support sparse files.
In particular FAT/exFAT do not.
Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem
which doesn\[aq]t support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message
if one is detected.
.SS VFS Chunked Reading
.PP
When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks.
This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an
increased number of requests.
.PP
These flags control the chunking:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will start reading a chunk of size
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], and then double the size for each read.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit\f[R] is specified, and greater
than \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], the chunk size for each open file
will get doubled only until the specified value is reached.
If the value is \[dq]off\[dq], which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.
.PP
With \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M\f[R] and
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0\f[R] the following parts will be
downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M\f[R] is specified, the result
would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so
on.
.PP
Setting \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R] to \f[C]0\f[R] or \[dq]off\[dq]
disables chunked reading.
.SS VFS Performance
.PP
These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons.
See also the chunked reading feature.
.PP
In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the
\f[C]--no-modtime\f[R] flag (or use \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R] for a
slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a
transaction.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--no-checksum     Don\[aq]t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don\[aq]t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don\[aq]t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order.
Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence
read or write to come in.
These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When using VFS write caching (\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] with value
writes or full), the global flag \f[C]--transfers\f[R] can be set to
adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache
(the related global flag \f[C]--checkers\f[R] has no effect on the VFS).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not
the default.
.PP
The \f[C]--vfs-case-insensitive\f[R] VFS flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[dq]false\[dq], rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is.
If the flag is \[dq]true\[dq] (or appears without a value on the command
line), rclone may perform a \[dq]fixup\[dq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
the underlying remote.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[dq]fixup\[dq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[dq]true\[dq] on
Windows and macOS, \[dq]false\[dq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[dq]true\[dq].
.SS Alternate report of used bytes
.PP
Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running \f[C]df\f[R]
on the filesystem, then pass the flag \f[C]--vfs-used-is-size\f[R] to
rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to
\f[C]rclone size\f[R] and compute the total used space itself.
.PP
\f[I]WARNING.\f[R] Contrary to \f[C]rclone size\f[R], this flag ignores
filters so that the result is accurate.
However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls
resulting in extra charges.
Use it as a last resort and only with caching.
.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[C]--auth-proxy /path/to/program\f[R] then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then
are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
\f[B]PLEASE NOTE:\f[R] \f[C]--auth-proxy\f[R] and
\f[C]--authorized-keys\f[R] cannot be used together, if
\f[C]--auth-proxy\f[R] is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program\[aq]s job is to take a \f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R] on
the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won\[aq]t use configuration from environment variables or command
line options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter - \f[C]_root\f[R] -
root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter - \f[C]_obscure\f[R] - comma separated
strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]public_key\[dq]: \[dq]AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And as an example return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
    \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
    \[dq]_obscure\[dq]: \[dq]pass\[dq],
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq],
    \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]sftp.example.com\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R]/\f[C]public_key\f[R] returned in the
output to the host given.
Note that since \f[C]_obscure\f[R] is set to \f[C]pass\f[R], rclone will
obscure the \f[C]pass\f[R] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The program can manipulate the supplied \f[C]user\f[R] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[C]user\f[R] be \f[C]user\[at]example.com\f[R] and then set the
\f[C]host\f[R] to \f[C]example.com\f[R] in the output and the user to
\f[C]user\f[R].
For security you\[aq]d probably want to restrict the \f[C]host\f[R] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[C]user\f[R] so only use that
for configuration, don\[aq]t use \f[C]pass\f[R] or \f[C]public_key\f[R].
This also means that if a user\[aq]s password or public-key is changed
the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes
effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

http read from it.
.PP
You can use the filter flags (e.g.
--include, --exclude) to control what is served.
.PP
The server will log errors.
Use -v to see access logs.
.PP
--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.
Use --stats to control the stats printing.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, eg --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.
.PP
--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to control
the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used --baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq] then rclone would serve from a
URL starting with \[dq]/rclone/\[dq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[dq]/\[dq] on
--baseurl, so --baseurl \[dq]rclone\[dq], --baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]
and --baseurl \[dq]/rclone/\[dq] are all treated identically.
.SS SSL/TLS
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply --client-ca also.
.PP
--cert should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.
--key should be the PEM encoded private key and --client-ca should be
the PEM encoded client certificate authority certificate.
.SS Template
.PP
--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions.
The server exports the following markup to be used within the template
to server pages:
.PP

.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.
.PP
Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use --realm to set the authentication realm.
.PP
Use --salt to change the password hashing salt from the default.
.SS VFS - Virtual File System
.PP
This command uses the VFS layer.
This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something
which looks much more like a disk filing system.
.PP
Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren\[aq]t like disk
files - you can\[aq]t extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that.
Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various
options explained below.
.PP
The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.
.SS VFS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]--dir-cache-time\f[R] flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the
polling interval.
.PP
You can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one open file and won\[aq]t be shared.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
.PP
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]--buffer-size * open files\f[R].
.SS VFS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a
normal file system.
It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.
.PP
For example you\[aq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven\[aq]t been accessed for \f[C]--vfs-write-back\f[R]
seconds.
If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven\[aq]t been uploaded,
these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.
.PP
If using \f[C]--vfs-cache-max-size\f[R] note that the cache may exceed
this size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\f[C]--vfs-cache-poll-interval\f[R].
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.PP
You \f[B]should not\f[R] run two copies of rclone using the same VFS
cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using
\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode > off\f[R].
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do.
You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy
with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R].
You don\[aq]t need to worry about this if the remotes in use don\[aq]t
overlap.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode off
.PP
In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[aq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[dq]off\[dq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disk.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.
.PP
In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.
.PP
So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file.
These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they
will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present
in them.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] writes.
.PP
When reading a file rclone will read \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] plus
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] bytes ahead.
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is buffered in memory whereas the
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is buffered on disk.
.PP
When using this mode it is recommended that \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is
not set too large and \f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is set large if
required.
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT\f[R] not all file systems support sparse files.
In particular FAT/exFAT do not.
Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem
which doesn\[aq]t support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message
if one is detected.
.SS VFS Chunked Reading
.PP
When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks.
This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an
increased number of requests.
.PP
These flags control the chunking:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will start reading a chunk of size
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], and then double the size for each read.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit\f[R] is specified, and greater
than \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], the chunk size for each open file
will get doubled only until the specified value is reached.
If the value is \[dq]off\[dq], which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.
.PP
With \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M\f[R] and
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0\f[R] the following parts will be
downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M\f[R] is specified, the result
would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so
on.
.PP
Setting \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R] to \f[C]0\f[R] or \[dq]off\[dq]
disables chunked reading.
.SS VFS Performance
.PP
These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons.
See also the chunked reading feature.
.PP
In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the
\f[C]--no-modtime\f[R] flag (or use \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R] for a
slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a
transaction.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--no-checksum     Don\[aq]t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don\[aq]t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don\[aq]t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order.
Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence
read or write to come in.
These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When using VFS write caching (\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] with value
writes or full), the global flag \f[C]--transfers\f[R] can be set to
adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache
(the related global flag \f[C]--checkers\f[R] has no effect on the VFS).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not
the default.
.PP
The \f[C]--vfs-case-insensitive\f[R] VFS flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[dq]false\[dq], rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is.
If the flag is \[dq]true\[dq] (or appears without a value on the command
line), rclone may perform a \[dq]fixup\[dq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
the underlying remote.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[dq]fixup\[dq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[dq]true\[dq] on
Windows and macOS, \[dq]false\[dq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[dq]true\[dq].
.SS Alternate report of used bytes
.PP
Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running \f[C]df\f[R]
on the filesystem, then pass the flag \f[C]--vfs-used-is-size\f[R] to
rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to
\f[C]rclone size\f[R] and compute the total used space itself.
.PP
\f[I]WARNING.\f[R] Contrary to \f[C]rclone size\f[R], this flag ignores
filters so that the result is accurate.
However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls
resulting in extra charges.
Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) - Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve restic
.PP
Serve the remote for restic\[aq]s REST API.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve restic implements restic\[aq]s REST backend API over HTTP.
This allows restic to use rclone as a data storage mechanism for cloud
providers that restic does not support directly.
.PP
Restic (https://restic.net/) is a command-line program for doing
backups.
.PP
The server will log errors.
Use -v to see access logs.
.PP
--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.
Use --stats to control the stats printing.
.SS Setting up rclone for use by restic
.PP
First set up a remote for your chosen cloud
provider (https://rclone.org/docs/#configure).
.PP
Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example
\[dq]rclone lsd remote:\[dq].
You may have called the remote something other than \[dq]remote:\[dq] -
just substitute whatever you called it in the following instructions.
.PP
Now start the rclone restic server
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone serve restic -v remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Where you can replace \[dq]backup\[dq] in the above by whatever path in
the remote you wish to use.
.PP
By default this will serve on \[dq]localhost:8080\[dq] you can change
this with use of the \[dq]--addr\[dq] flag.

You might wish to start this server on boot.
.PP
Adding --cache-objects=false will cause rclone to stop caching objects
returned from the List call.
Caching is normally desirable as it speeds up downloading objects, saves
transactions and uses very little memory.
.SS Setting up restic to use rclone
.PP
Now you can follow the restic
instructions (http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server)
on setting up restic.
.PP
Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with
rclone.
.PP
For the example above you will want to use
\[dq]http://localhost:8080/\[dq] as the URL for the REST server.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
$ export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
$ restic init
created restic backend 8b1a4b56ae at rest:http://localhost:8080/

Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
irrecoverably lost.
$ restic backup /path/to/files/to/backup
scan [/path/to/files/to/backup]
scanned 189 directories, 312 files in 0:00
[0:00] 100.00%  38.128 MiB / 38.128 MiB  501 / 501 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
duration: 0:00
snapshot 45c8fdd8 saved
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Multiple repositories
.PP
Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories.
Do this by adding a directory name or path after the URL.
Note that these \f[B]must\f[R] end with /.
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/
# backup user1 stuff
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
# backup user2 stuff
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Private repositories
.PP
The \[dq]--private-repos\[dq] flag can be used to limit users to
repositories starting with a path of \f[C]/<username>/\f[R].
.SS Server options
.PP
Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, e.g.
--addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.
.PP
--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to control
the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used --baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq] then rclone would serve from a
URL starting with \[dq]/rclone/\[dq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[dq]/\[dq] on
--baseurl, so --baseurl \[dq]rclone\[dq], --baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]
and --baseurl \[dq]/rclone/\[dq] are all treated identically.
.PP
--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions.
The server exports the following markup to be used within the template
to server pages:
.PP

.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.
.PP
Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use --realm to set the authentication realm.
.SS SSL/TLS
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply --client-ca also.
.PP
--cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation of
that with the CA certificate.
--key should be the PEM encoded private key and --client-ca should be
the PEM encoded client certificate authority certificate.

.IP \[bu] 2
rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) - Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve sftp
.PP
Serve the remote over SFTP.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve sftp implements an SFTP server to serve the remote over
SFTP.
This can be used with an SFTP client or you can make a remote of type
sftp to use with it.
.PP
You can use the filter flags (e.g.
--include, --exclude) to control what is served.
.PP
The server will log errors.
Use -v to see access logs.
.PP
--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.
Use --stats to control the stats printing.
.PP
You must provide some means of authentication, either with
--user/--pass, an authorized keys file (specify location with
--authorized-keys - the default is the same as ssh), an --auth-proxy, or
set the --no-auth flag for no authentication when logging in.
.PP
Note that this also implements a small number of shell commands so that
it can provide md5sum/sha1sum/df information for the rclone sftp
backend.
This means that is can support SHA1SUMs, MD5SUMs and the about command
when paired with the rclone sftp backend.
.PP
If you don\[aq]t supply a host --key then rclone will generate rsa,
ecdsa and ed25519 variants, and cache them for later use in rclone\[aq]s
cache directory (see \[dq]rclone help flags cache-dir\[dq]) in the
\[dq]serve-sftp\[dq] directory.
.PP
By default the server binds to localhost:2022 - if you want it to be
reachable externally then supply \[dq]--addr :2022\[dq] for example.
.PP
Note that the default of \[dq]--vfs-cache-mode off\[dq] is fine for the
rclone sftp backend, but it may not be with other SFTP clients.
.PP
If --stdio is specified, rclone will serve SFTP over stdio, which can be
used with sshd via \[ti]/.ssh/authorized_keys, for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
restrict,command=\[dq]rclone serve sftp --stdio ./photos\[dq] ssh-rsa ...
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
On the client you need to set \[dq]--transfers 1\[dq] when using
--stdio.
Otherwise multiple instances of the rclone server are started by OpenSSH
which can lead to \[dq]corrupted on transfer\[dq] errors.
This is the case because the client chooses indiscriminately which
server to send commands to while the servers all have different views of
the state of the filing system.
.PP
The \[dq]restrict\[dq] in authorized_keys prevents SHA1SUMs and MD5SUMs
from beeing used.
Omitting \[dq]restrict\[dq] and using --sftp-path-override to enable
checksumming is possible but less secure and you could use the SFTP
server provided by OpenSSH in this case.
.SS VFS - Virtual File System
.PP
This command uses the VFS layer.
This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something
which looks much more like a disk filing system.
.PP
Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren\[aq]t like disk
files - you can\[aq]t extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that.
Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various
options explained below.
.PP
The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.
.SS VFS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]--dir-cache-time\f[R] flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the
polling interval.
.PP
You can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one open file and won\[aq]t be shared.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
.PP
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]--buffer-size * open files\f[R].
.SS VFS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a
normal file system.
It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.
.PP
For example you\[aq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven\[aq]t been accessed for \f[C]--vfs-write-back\f[R]
seconds.
If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven\[aq]t been uploaded,
these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.
.PP
If using \f[C]--vfs-cache-max-size\f[R] note that the cache may exceed
this size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\f[C]--vfs-cache-poll-interval\f[R].
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.PP
You \f[B]should not\f[R] run two copies of rclone using the same VFS
cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using
\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode > off\f[R].
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do.
You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy
with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R].
You don\[aq]t need to worry about this if the remotes in use don\[aq]t
overlap.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode off
.PP
In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[aq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[dq]off\[dq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disk.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.
.PP
In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.
.PP
So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file.
These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they
will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present
in them.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] writes.
.PP
When reading a file rclone will read \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] plus
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] bytes ahead.
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is buffered in memory whereas the
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is buffered on disk.
.PP
When using this mode it is recommended that \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is
not set too large and \f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is set large if
required.
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT\f[R] not all file systems support sparse files.
In particular FAT/exFAT do not.
Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem
which doesn\[aq]t support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message
if one is detected.
.SS VFS Chunked Reading
.PP
When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks.
This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an
increased number of requests.
.PP
These flags control the chunking:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will start reading a chunk of size
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], and then double the size for each read.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit\f[R] is specified, and greater
than \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], the chunk size for each open file
will get doubled only until the specified value is reached.
If the value is \[dq]off\[dq], which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.
.PP
With \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M\f[R] and
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0\f[R] the following parts will be
downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M\f[R] is specified, the result
would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so
on.
.PP
Setting \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R] to \f[C]0\f[R] or \[dq]off\[dq]
disables chunked reading.
.SS VFS Performance
.PP
These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons.
See also the chunked reading feature.
.PP
In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the
\f[C]--no-modtime\f[R] flag (or use \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R] for a
slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a
transaction.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--no-checksum     Don\[aq]t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don\[aq]t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don\[aq]t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order.
Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence
read or write to come in.
These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When using VFS write caching (\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] with value
writes or full), the global flag \f[C]--transfers\f[R] can be set to
adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache
(the related global flag \f[C]--checkers\f[R] has no effect on the VFS).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not
the default.
.PP
The \f[C]--vfs-case-insensitive\f[R] VFS flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[dq]false\[dq], rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is.
If the flag is \[dq]true\[dq] (or appears without a value on the command
line), rclone may perform a \[dq]fixup\[dq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
the underlying remote.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[dq]fixup\[dq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[dq]true\[dq] on
Windows and macOS, \[dq]false\[dq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[dq]true\[dq].
.SS Alternate report of used bytes
.PP
Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running \f[C]df\f[R]
on the filesystem, then pass the flag \f[C]--vfs-used-is-size\f[R] to
rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to
\f[C]rclone size\f[R] and compute the total used space itself.
.PP
\f[I]WARNING.\f[R] Contrary to \f[C]rclone size\f[R], this flag ignores
filters so that the result is accurate.
However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls
resulting in extra charges.
Use it as a last resort and only with caching.
.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[C]--auth-proxy /path/to/program\f[R] then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then
are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
\f[B]PLEASE NOTE:\f[R] \f[C]--auth-proxy\f[R] and
\f[C]--authorized-keys\f[R] cannot be used together, if
\f[C]--auth-proxy\f[R] is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program\[aq]s job is to take a \f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R] on
the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won\[aq]t use configuration from environment variables or command
line options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter - \f[C]_root\f[R] -
root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter - \f[C]_obscure\f[R] - comma separated
strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]public_key\[dq]: \[dq]AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And as an example return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
    \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
    \[dq]_obscure\[dq]: \[dq]pass\[dq],
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq],
    \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]sftp.example.com\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R]/\f[C]public_key\f[R] returned in the
output to the host given.
Note that since \f[C]_obscure\f[R] is set to \f[C]pass\f[R], rclone will
obscure the \f[C]pass\f[R] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The program can manipulate the supplied \f[C]user\f[R] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[C]user\f[R] be \f[C]user\[at]example.com\f[R] and then set the
\f[C]host\f[R] to \f[C]example.com\f[R] in the output and the user to
\f[C]user\f[R].
For security you\[aq]d probably want to restrict the \f[C]host\f[R] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[C]user\f[R] so only use that
for configuration, don\[aq]t use \f[C]pass\f[R] or \f[C]public_key\f[R].
This also means that if a user\[aq]s password or public-key is changed
the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes
effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) - Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve webdav
.PP
Serve remote:path over webdav.
.SS Synopsis
.PP
rclone serve webdav implements a basic webdav server to serve the remote
over HTTP via the webdav protocol.
This can be viewed with a webdav client, through a web browser, or you
can make a remote of type webdav to read and write it.
.SS Webdav options
.SS --etag-hash
.PP
This controls the ETag header.
Without this flag the ETag will be based on the ModTime and Size of the
object.
.PP
If this flag is set to \[dq]auto\[dq] then rclone will choose the first
supported hash on the backend or you can use a named hash such as
\[dq]MD5\[dq] or \[dq]SHA-1\[dq].
.PP
Use \[dq]rclone hashsum\[dq] to see the full list.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, e.g.
--addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.
.PP
--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to control
the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used --baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq] then rclone would serve from a
URL starting with \[dq]/rclone/\[dq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[dq]/\[dq] on
--baseurl, so --baseurl \[dq]rclone\[dq], --baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]
and --baseurl \[dq]/rclone/\[dq] are all treated identically.
.PP
--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions.
The server exports the following markup to be used within the template
to server pages:

.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.
.PP
Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use --realm to set the authentication realm.
.SS SSL/TLS
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply --client-ca also.
.PP
--cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation of
that with the CA certificate.
--key should be the PEM encoded private key and --client-ca should be
the PEM encoded client certificate authority certificate.
.SS VFS - Virtual File System
.PP
This command uses the VFS layer.
This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something
which looks much more like a disk filing system.
.PP
Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren\[aq]t like disk
files - you can\[aq]t extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that.
Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various
options explained below.
.PP
The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.
.SS VFS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[C]--dir-cache-time\f[R] flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
--poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the
polling interval.
.PP
You can send a \f[C]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one open file and won\[aq]t be shared.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
.PP
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[C]--buffer-size * open files\f[R].
.SS VFS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a
normal file system.
It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.
.PP
For example you\[aq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
--vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
--vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
--vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
--vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
--vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[C]-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven\[aq]t been accessed for \f[C]--vfs-write-back\f[R]
seconds.
If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven\[aq]t been uploaded,
these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same flags.
.PP
If using \f[C]--vfs-cache-max-size\f[R] note that the cache may exceed
this size for two reasons.
Firstly because it is only checked every
\f[C]--vfs-cache-poll-interval\f[R].
Secondly because open files cannot be evicted from the cache.
.PP
You \f[B]should not\f[R] run two copies of rclone using the same VFS
cache with the same or overlapping remotes if using
\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode > off\f[R].
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do.
You can work around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy
with \f[C]--cache-dir\f[R].
You don\[aq]t need to worry about this if the remotes in use don\[aq]t
overlap.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode off
.PP
In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote
and write directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.
.PP
This will mean some operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files can\[aq]t be opened for both read AND write
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
.IP \[bu] 2
Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
.IP \[bu] 2
Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode minimal
.PP
This is very similar to \[dq]off\[dq] except that files opened for read
AND write will be buffered to disk.
This means that files opened for write will be a lot more compatible,
but uses the minimal disk space.
.PP
These operations are not possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only can\[aq]t be seeked
.IP \[bu] 2
Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
.IP \[bu] 2
Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
.IP \[bu] 2
If an upload fails it can\[aq]t be retried
.SS --vfs-cache-mode writes
.PP
In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations.
.PP
If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.
.SS --vfs-cache-mode full
.PP
In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.
When data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.
.PP
In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone will
keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.
.PP
So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file.
These files will appear to be their full size in the cache, but they
will be sparse files with only the data that has been downloaded present
in them.
.PP
This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] writes.
.PP
When reading a file rclone will read \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] plus
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] bytes ahead.
The \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is buffered in memory whereas the
\f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is buffered on disk.
.PP
When using this mode it is recommended that \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] is
not set too large and \f[C]--vfs-read-ahead\f[R] is set large if
required.
.PP
\f[B]IMPORTANT\f[R] not all file systems support sparse files.
In particular FAT/exFAT do not.
Rclone will perform very badly if the cache directory is on a filesystem
which doesn\[aq]t support sparse files and it will log an ERROR message
if one is detected.
.SS VFS Chunked Reading
.PP
When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks.
This means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read, at the cost of an
increased number of requests.
.PP
These flags control the chunking:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will start reading a chunk of size
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], and then double the size for each read.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit\f[R] is specified, and greater
than \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R], the chunk size for each open file
will get doubled only until the specified value is reached.
If the value is \[dq]off\[dq], which is the default, the limit is
disabled and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.
.PP
With \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M\f[R] and
\f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0\f[R] the following parts will be
downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M\f[R] is specified, the result
would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so
on.
.PP
Setting \f[C]--vfs-read-chunk-size\f[R] to \f[C]0\f[R] or \[dq]off\[dq]
disables chunked reading.
.SS VFS Performance
.PP
These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons.
See also the chunked reading feature.
.PP
In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the
\f[C]--no-modtime\f[R] flag (or use \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R] for a
slightly different effect) as each read of the modification time takes a
transaction.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--no-checksum     Don\[aq]t compare checksums on up/download.
--no-modtime      Don\[aq]t read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
--no-seek         Don\[aq]t allow seeking in files.
--read-only       Only allow read-only access.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order.
Rather than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence
read or write to come in.
These flags only come into effect when not using an on disk cache file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
--vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When using VFS write caching (\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] with value
writes or full), the global flag \f[C]--transfers\f[R] can be set to
adjust the number of parallel uploads of modified files from the cache
(the related global flag \f[C]--checkers\f[R] has no effect on the VFS).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS Case Sensitivity
.PP
Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only by
case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.
.PP
File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case
used to create the file is preserved and available for programs to
query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by
case.
.PP
Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive.
It is possible to make macOS file systems case-sensitive but that is not
the default.
.PP
The \f[C]--vfs-case-insensitive\f[R] VFS flag controls how rclone
handles these two cases.
If its value is \[dq]false\[dq], rclone passes file names to the remote
as-is.
If the flag is \[dq]true\[dq] (or appears without a value on the command
line), rclone may perform a \[dq]fixup\[dq] as explained below.
.PP
The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on the remote.
If an argument refers to an existing file with exactly the same name,
then the case of the existing file on the disk will be used.
However, if a file name with exactly the same name is not found but a
name differing only by case exists, rclone will transparently fixup the
name.
This fixup happens only when an existing file is requested.
Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is controlled by
the underlying remote.
.PP
Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the
target) may differ from case sensitivity of a file system presented by
rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether \[dq]fixup\[dq] is performed to satisfy the
target.
.PP
If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value
depends on the operating system where rclone runs: \[dq]true\[dq] on
Windows and macOS, \[dq]false\[dq] otherwise.
If the flag is provided without a value, then it is \[dq]true\[dq].
.SS Alternate report of used bytes
.PP
Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running \f[C]df\f[R]
on the filesystem, then pass the flag \f[C]--vfs-used-is-size\f[R] to
rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to
\f[C]rclone size\f[R] and compute the total used space itself.
.PP
\f[I]WARNING.\f[R] Contrary to \f[C]rclone size\f[R], this flag ignores
filters so that the result is accurate.
However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API calls
resulting in extra charges.
Use it as a last resort and only with caching.
.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[C]--auth-proxy /path/to/program\f[R] then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then
are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
\f[B]PLEASE NOTE:\f[R] \f[C]--auth-proxy\f[R] and
\f[C]--authorized-keys\f[R] cannot be used together, if
\f[C]--auth-proxy\f[R] is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program\[aq]s job is to take a \f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R] on
the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won\[aq]t use configuration from environment variables or command
line options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter - \f[C]_root\f[R] -
root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter - \f[C]_obscure\f[R] - comma separated
strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]public_key\[dq]: \[dq]AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And as an example return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
    \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
    \[dq]_obscure\[dq]: \[dq]pass\[dq],
    \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
    \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq],
    \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]sftp.example.com\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[C]user\f[R] and \f[C]pass\f[R]/\f[C]public_key\f[R] returned in the
output to the host given.
Note that since \f[C]_obscure\f[R] is set to \f[C]pass\f[R], rclone will
obscure the \f[C]pass\f[R] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The program can manipulate the supplied \f[C]user\f[R] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[C]user\f[R] be \f[C]user\[at]example.com\f[R] and then set the
\f[C]host\f[R] to \f[C]example.com\f[R] in the output and the user to
\f[C]user\f[R].
For security you\[aq]d probably want to restrict the \f[C]host\f[R] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[C]user\f[R] so only use that
for configuration, don\[aq]t use \f[C]pass\f[R] or \f[C]public_key\f[R].
This also means that if a user\[aq]s password or public-key is changed
the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes
effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

.PP
For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called
\f[C]test.jpg\f[R], then you could copy just that file like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy remote:test.jpg /tmp/download
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The file \f[C]test.jpg\f[R] will be placed inside
\f[C]/tmp/download\f[R].
.PP
This is equivalent to specifying
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --files-from /tmp/files remote: /tmp/download
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Where \f[C]/tmp/files\f[R] contains the single line
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
test.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
It is recommended to use \f[C]copy\f[R] when copying individual files,
not \f[C]sync\f[R].
They have pretty much the same effect but \f[C]copy\f[R] will use a lot
less memory.
.SS Syntax of remote paths
.PP
The syntax of the paths passed to the rclone command are as follows.
.SS /path/to/dir
.PP
This refers to the local file system.
.PP
On Windows \f[C]\[rs]\f[R] may be used instead of \f[C]/\f[R] in local
paths \f[B]only\f[R], non local paths must use \f[C]/\f[R].
See local filesystem (https://rclone.org/local/#paths-on-windows)
documentation for more about Windows-specific paths.
.PP
These paths needn\[aq]t start with a leading \f[C]/\f[R] - if they
don\[aq]t then they will be relative to the current directory.
.SS remote:path/to/dir
.PP
This refers to a directory \f[C]path/to/dir\f[R] on \f[C]remote:\f[R] as
defined in the config file (configured with \f[C]rclone config\f[R]).
.SS remote:/path/to/dir
.PP
On most backends this is refers to the same directory as
\f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[R] and that format should be preferred.
On a very small number of remotes (FTP, SFTP, Dropbox for business) this
will refer to a different directory.
On these, paths without a leading \f[C]/\f[R] will refer to your
\[dq]home\[dq] directory and paths with a leading \f[C]/\f[R] will refer
to the root.
.SS :backend:path/to/dir
.PP
This is an advanced form for creating remotes on the fly.
\f[C]backend\f[R] should be the name or prefix of a backend (the
\f[C]type\f[R] in the config file) and all the configuration for the
backend should be provided on the command line (or in environment
variables).
.PP
Here are some examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd --http-url https://pub.rclone.org :http:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To list all the directories in the root of
\f[C]https://pub.rclone.org/\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsf --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To list files and directories in
\f[C]https://example.com/path/to/dir/\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir /tmp/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To copy files and directories in
\f[C]https://example.com/path/to/dir\f[R] to \f[C]/tmp/dir\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --sftp-host example.com :sftp:path/to/dir /tmp/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To copy files and directories from \f[C]example.com\f[R] in the relative
directory \f[C]path/to/dir\f[R] to \f[C]/tmp/dir\f[R] using sftp.
.SS Connection strings
.PP
The above examples can also be written using a connection string syntax,
so instead of providing the arguments as command line parameters
\f[C]--http-url https://pub.rclone.org\f[R] they are provided as part of
the remote specification as a kind of connection string.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd \[dq]:http,url=\[aq]https://pub.rclone.org\[aq]:\[dq]
rclone lsf \[dq]:http,url=\[aq]https://example.com\[aq]:path/to/dir\[dq]
rclone copy \[dq]:http,url=\[aq]https://example.com\[aq]:path/to/dir\[dq] /tmp/dir
rclone copy :sftp,host=example.com:path/to/dir /tmp/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
These can apply to modify existing remotes as well as create new remotes
with the on the fly syntax.
This example is equivalent to adding the
\f[C]--drive-shared-with-me\f[R] parameter to the remote
\f[C]gdrive:\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsf \[dq]gdrive,shared_with_me:path/to/dir\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The major advantage to using the connection string style syntax is that
it only applies to the remote, not to all the remotes of that type of
the command line.
A common confusion is this attempt to copy a file shared on google drive
to the normal drive which \f[B]does not work\f[R] because the
\f[C]--drive-shared-with-me\f[R] flag applies to both the source and the
destination.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --drive-shared-with-me gdrive:shared-file.txt gdrive:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However using the connection string syntax, this does work.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[dq]gdrive,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt\[dq] gdrive:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that the connection string only affects the options of the
immediate backend.
If for example gdriveCrypt is a crypt based on gdrive, then the
following command \f[B]will not work\f[R] as intended, because
\f[C]shared_with_me\f[R] is ignored by the crypt backend:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[dq]gdriveCrypt,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt\[dq] gdriveCrypt:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The connection strings have the following syntax
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
remote,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir
:backend,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If the \f[C]parameter\f[R] has a \f[C]:\f[R] or \f[C],\f[R] then it must
be placed in quotes \f[C]\[dq]\f[R] or \f[C]\[aq]\f[R], so
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
remote,parameter=\[dq]colon:value\[dq],parameter2=\[dq]comma,value\[dq]:path/to/dir
:backend,parameter=\[aq]colon:value\[aq],parameter2=\[aq]comma,value\[aq]:path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If a quoted value needs to include that quote, then it should be
doubled, so
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
remote,parameter=\[dq]with\[dq]\[dq]quote\[dq],parameter2=\[aq]with\[aq]\[aq]quote\[aq]:path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will make \f[C]parameter\f[R] be \f[C]with\[dq]quote\f[R] and
\f[C]parameter2\f[R] be \f[C]with\[aq]quote\f[R].
.PP
If you leave off the \f[C]=parameter\f[R] then rclone will substitute
\f[C]=true\f[R] which works very well with flags.
For example, to use s3 configured in the environment you could use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd :s3,env_auth:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Which is equivalent to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd :s3,env_auth=true:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that on the command line you might need to surround these
connection strings with \f[C]\[dq]\f[R] or \f[C]\[aq]\f[R] to stop the
shell interpreting any special characters within them.
.PP
If you are a shell master then you\[aq]ll know which strings are OK and
which aren\[aq]t, but if you aren\[aq]t sure then enclose them in
\f[C]\[dq]\f[R] and use \f[C]\[aq]\f[R] as the inside quote.
This syntax works on all OSes.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[dq]:http,url=\[aq]https://example.com\[aq]:path/to/dir\[dq] /tmp/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
On Linux/macOS some characters are still interpreted inside
\f[C]\[dq]\f[R] strings in the shell (notably \f[C]\[rs]\f[R] and
\f[C]$\f[R] and \f[C]\[dq]\f[R]) so if your strings contain those you
can swap the roles of \f[C]\[dq]\f[R] and \f[C]\[aq]\f[R] thus.
(This syntax does not work on Windows.)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[aq]:http,url=\[dq]https://example.com\[dq]:path/to/dir\[aq] /tmp/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Connection strings, config and logging
.PP
If you supply extra configuration to a backend by command line flag,
environment variable or connection string then rclone will add a suffix
based on the hash of the config to the name of the remote, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone -vv lsf --s3-chunk-size 20M s3:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Has the log message
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
DEBUG : s3: detected overridden config - adding \[dq]{Srj1p}\[dq] suffix to name
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This is so rclone can tell the modified remote apart from the unmodified
remote when caching the backends.
.PP
This should only be noticeable in the logs.
.PP
This means that on the fly backends such as
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone -vv lsf :s3,env_auth:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Will get their own names
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
DEBUG : :s3: detected overridden config - adding \[dq]{YTu53}\[dq] suffix to name
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Valid remote names
.PP
Remote names are case sensitive, and must adhere to the following rules:
- May only contain \f[C]0\f[R]-\f[C]9\f[R], \f[C]A\f[R]-\f[C]Z\f[R],
\f[C]a\f[R]-\f[C]z\f[R], \f[C]_\f[R], \f[C]-\f[R], \f[C].\f[R] and
space.
- May not start with \f[C]-\f[R] or space.
.SS Quoting and the shell
.PP
When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell.
This interprets various characters in an OS specific way.
.PP
Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell
rules
.SS Linux / OSX
.PP
If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (e.g.
\f[C]*\f[R], \f[C]?\f[R], \f[C]$\f[R], \f[C]\[aq]\f[R], \f[C]\[dq]\f[R],
etc.) then you must quote them.
Use single quotes \f[C]\[aq]\f[R] by default.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[aq]Important files?\[aq] remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you want to send a \f[C]\[aq]\f[R] you will need to use
\f[C]\[dq]\f[R], e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[dq]O\[aq]Reilly Reviews\[dq] remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want the
full details you\[aq]ll have to consult the manual page for your shell.
.SS Windows
.PP
If your names have spaces in you need to put them in \f[C]\[dq]\f[R],
e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy \[dq]E:\[rs]folder name\[rs]folder name\[rs]folder name\[dq] remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you are using the root directory on its own then don\[aq]t quote it
(see #464 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/464) for why), e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy E:\[rs] remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Copying files or directories with \f[C]:\f[R] in the names
.PP
rclone uses \f[C]:\f[R] to mark a remote name.
This is, however, a valid filename component in non-Windows OSes.
The remote name parser will only search for a \f[C]:\f[R] up to the
first \f[C]/\f[R] so if you need to act on a file or directory like this
then use the full path starting with a \f[C]/\f[R], or use \f[C]./\f[R]
as a current directory prefix.
.PP
So to sync a directory called \f[C]sync:me\f[R] to a remote called
\f[C]remote:\f[R] use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync -i ./sync:me remote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync -i /full/path/to/sync:me remote:path
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Server Side Copy
.PP
Most remotes (but not all - see the
overview (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)) support
server-side copy.
.PP
This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone
won\[aq]t download all the files and re-upload them; it will instruct
the server to copy them in place.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Will copy the contents of \f[C]oldbucket\f[R] to \f[C]newbucket\f[R]
without downloading and re-uploading.
.PP
Remotes which don\[aq]t support server-side copy \f[B]will\f[R] download
and re-upload in this case.
.PP
Server side copies are used with \f[C]sync\f[R] and \f[C]copy\f[R] and
will be identified in the log when using the \f[C]-v\f[R] flag.
The \f[C]move\f[R] command may also use them if remote doesn\[aq]t
support server-side move directly.
This is done by issuing a server-side copy then a delete which is much
quicker than a download and re-upload.
.PP
Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.
.PP
This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync -i remote:current-backup remote:previous-backup
rclone sync -i /path/to/files remote:current-backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Options
.PP
Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.
.PP
Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways,
\f[C]--option=value\f[R] or \f[C]--option value\f[R].
However boolean (true/false) options behave slightly differently to the
other options in that \f[C]--boolean\f[R] sets the option to
\f[C]true\f[R] and the absence of the flag sets it to \f[C]false\f[R].
It is also possible to specify \f[C]--boolean=false\f[R] or
\f[C]--boolean=true\f[R].
Note that \f[C]--boolean false\f[R] is not valid - this is parsed as
\f[C]--boolean\f[R] and the \f[C]false\f[R] is parsed as an extra
command line argument for rclone.
.PP
Options which use TIME use the go time parser.
A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each
with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as \[dq]300ms\[dq],
\[dq]-1.5h\[dq] or \[dq]2h45m\[dq].
Valid time units are \[dq]ns\[dq], \[dq]us\[dq] (or \[dq]\[mc]s\[dq]),
\[dq]ms\[dq], \[dq]s\[dq], \[dq]m\[dq], \[dq]h\[dq].
.PP
Options which use SIZE use KiB (multiples of 1024 bytes) by default.
However, a suffix of \f[C]B\f[R] for Byte, \f[C]K\f[R] for KiB,
\f[C]M\f[R] for MiB, \f[C]G\f[R] for GiB, \f[C]T\f[R] for TiB and
\f[C]P\f[R] for PiB may be used.
These are the binary units, e.g.
1, 2**10, 2**20, 2**30 respectively.
.SS --backup-dir=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R] any files
which would have been overwritten or deleted are moved in their original
hierarchy into this directory.
.PP
If \f[C]--suffix\f[R] is set, then the moved files will have the suffix
added to them.
If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added)
in DIR, then it will be overwritten.
.PP
The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.
The backup directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync -i /path/to/local remote:current --backup-dir remote:old
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
will sync \f[C]/path/to/local\f[R] to \f[C]remote:current\f[R], but for
any files which would have been updated or deleted will be stored in
\f[C]remote:old\f[R].
.PP
If running rclone from a script you might want to use today\[aq]s date
as the directory name passed to \f[C]--backup-dir\f[R] to store the old
files, or you might want to pass \f[C]--suffix\f[R] with today\[aq]s
date.
.PP
See \f[C]--compare-dest\f[R] and \f[C]--copy-dest\f[R].
.SS --bind string
.PP
Local address to bind to for outgoing connections.
This can be an IPv4 address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or
host name.
If the host name doesn\[aq]t resolve or resolves to more than one IP
address it will give an error.
.SS --bwlimit=BANDWIDTH_SPEC
.PP
This option controls the bandwidth limit.
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--bwlimit 10M
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
would mean limit the upload and download bandwidth to 10 MiB/s.
\f[B]NB\f[R] this is \f[B]bytes\f[R] per second not \f[B]bits\f[R] per
second.
To use a single limit, specify the desired bandwidth in KiB/s, or use a
suffix B|K|M|G|T|P.
The default is \f[C]0\f[R] which means to not limit bandwidth.
.PP
The upload and download bandwidth can be specified seperately, as
\f[C]--bwlimit UP:DOWN\f[R], so
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--bwlimit 10M:100k
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
would mean limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s and the download
bandwidth to 100 KiB/s.
Either limit can be \[dq]off\[dq] meaning no limit, so to just limit the
upload bandwidth you would use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--bwlimit 10M:off
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
this would limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s but the download
bandwidth would be unlimited.
.PP
When specified as above the bandwidth limits last for the duration of
run of the rclone binary.
.PP
It is also possible to specify a \[dq]timetable\[dq] of limits, which
will cause certain limits to be applied at certain times.
To specify a timetable, format your entries as
\f[C]WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH...\f[R] where:
\f[C]WEEKDAY\f[R] is optional element.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]BANDWIDTH\f[R] can be a single number, e.g.\f[C]100k\f[R] or a pair
of numbers for upload:download, e.g.\f[C]10M:1M\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]WEEKDAY\f[R] can be written as the whole word or only using the
first 3 characters.
It is optional.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]HH:MM\f[R] is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.
.PP
An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during
daytime working hours could be:
.PP
\f[C]--bwlimit \[dq]08:00,512k 12:00,10M 13:00,512k 18:00,30M 23:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
In this example, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s at 8am
every day.
At noon, it will rise to 10 MiB/s, and drop back to 512 KiB/sec at 1pm.
At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to 30 MiB/s, and at 11pm it will
be completely disabled (full speed).
Anything between 11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.
.PP
An example of timetable with \f[C]WEEKDAY\f[R] could be:
.PP
\f[C]--bwlimit \[dq]Mon-00:00,512 Fri-23:59,10M Sat-10:00,1M Sun-20:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
It means that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s on
Monday.
It will rise to 10 MiB/s before the end of Friday.
At 10:00 on Saturday it will be set to 1 MiB/s.
From 20:00 on Sunday it will be unlimited.
.PP
Timeslots without \f[C]WEEKDAY\f[R] are extended to the whole week.
So this example:
.PP
\f[C]--bwlimit \[dq]Mon-00:00,512 12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
Is equivalent to this:
.PP
\f[C]--bwlimit \[dq]Mon-00:00,512Mon-12:00,1M Tue-12:00,1M Wed-12:00,1M Thu-12:00,1M Fri-12:00,1M Sat-12:00,1M Sun-12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
Bandwidth limit apply to the data transfer for all backends.
For most backends the directory listing bandwidth is also included
(exceptions being the non HTTP backends, \f[C]ftp\f[R], \f[C]sftp\f[R]
and \f[C]storj\f[R]).
.PP
Note that the units are \f[B]Byte/s\f[R], not \f[B]bit/s\f[R].
Typically connections are measured in bit/s - to convert divide by 8.
For example, let\[aq]s say you have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish
rclone to use half of it - 5 Mbit/s.
This is 5/8 = 0.625 MiB/s so you would use a \f[C]--bwlimit 0.625M\f[R]
parameter for rclone.
.PP
On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, \&...) the bandwidth limiter can be
toggled by sending a \f[C]SIGUSR2\f[R] signal to rclone.
This allows to remove the limitations of a long running rclone transfer
and to restore it back to the value specified with \f[C]--bwlimit\f[R]
quickly when needed.
Assuming there is only one rclone instance running, you can toggle the
limiter like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill -SIGUSR2 $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use change
the bwlimit dynamically:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M
\f[R]
.fi
.SS --bwlimit-file=BANDWIDTH_SPEC
.PP
This option controls per file bandwidth limit.
For the options see the \f[C]--bwlimit\f[R] flag.
.PP
For example use this to allow no transfers to be faster than 1 MiB/s
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--bwlimit-file 1M
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This can be used in conjunction with \f[C]--bwlimit\f[R].
.PP
Note that if a schedule is provided the file will use the schedule in
effect at the start of the transfer.
.SS --buffer-size=SIZE
.PP
Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers.
Each \f[C]--transfer\f[R] will use this much memory for buffering.
.PP
When using \f[C]mount\f[R] or \f[C]cmount\f[R] each open file descriptor
will use this much memory for buffering.
See the mount (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#file-buffering)
documentation for more details.
.PP
Set to \f[C]0\f[R] to disable the buffering for the minimum memory
usage.
.PP
Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by the
--use-mmap flag.
.SS --cache-dir=DIR
.PP
Specify the directory rclone will use for caching, to override the
default.
.PP
Default value is depending on operating system: - Windows
\f[C]%LocalAppData%\[rs]rclone\f[R], if \f[C]LocalAppData\f[R] is
defined.
- macOS \f[C]$HOME/Library/Caches/rclone\f[R] if \f[C]HOME\f[R] is
defined.
- Unix \f[C]$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rclone\f[R] if \f[C]XDG_CACHE_HOME\f[R] is
defined, else \f[C]$HOME/.cache/rclone\f[R] if \f[C]HOME\f[R] is
defined.
- Fallback (on all OS) to \f[C]$TMPDIR/rclone\f[R], where
\f[C]TMPDIR\f[R] is the value from --temp-dir.
.PP
You can use the config
paths (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/) command to see
the current value.
.PP
Cache directory is heavily used by the VFS File
Caching (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-file-caching)
mount feature, but also by
serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/), GUI and other parts
of rclone.
.SS --check-first
.PP
If this flag is set then in a \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or
\f[C]move\f[R], rclone will do all the checks to see whether files need
to be transferred before doing any of the transfers.
Normally rclone would start running transfers as soon as possible.
.PP
This flag can be useful on IO limited systems where transfers interfere
with checking.
.PP
It can also be useful to ensure perfect ordering when using
\f[C]--order-by\f[R].
.PP
Using this flag can use more memory as it effectively sets
\f[C]--max-backlog\f[R] to infinite.
This means that all the info on the objects to transfer is held in
memory before the transfers start.
.SS --checkers=N
.PP
The number of checkers to run in parallel.
Checkers do the equality checking of files during a sync.
For some storage systems (e.g.
S3, Swift, Dropbox) this can take a significant amount of time so they
are run in parallel.
.PP
The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.
.SS -c, --checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check the file hash and size to
determine if files are equal.
.PP
This is useful when the remote doesn\[aq]t support setting modified time
and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.
.PP
This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, e.g.
Drive and Swift.
For details of which remotes support which hash type see the table in
the overview section (https://rclone.org/overview/).
.PP
Eg \f[C]rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket\f[R] would run
much quicker than without the \f[C]--checksum\f[R] flag.
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.
.SS --compare-dest=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R] DIR is
checked in addition to the destination for files.
If a file identical to the source is found that file is NOT copied from
source.
This is useful to copy just files that have changed since the last
backup.
.PP
You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync.
The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
See \f[C]--copy-dest\f[R] and \f[C]--backup-dir\f[R].
.SS --config=CONFIG_FILE
.PP
Specify the location of the rclone configuration file, to override the
default.
E.g.
\f[C]rclone config --config=\[dq]rclone.conf\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
The exact default is a bit complex to describe, due to changes
introduced through different versions of rclone while preserving
backwards compatibility, but in most cases it is as simple as:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] on Windows
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\[ti]/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] on other
.PP
The complete logic is as follows: Rclone will look for an existing
configuration file in any of the following locations, in priority order:
.IP "1." 3
\f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] (in program directory, where rclone executable is)
.IP "2." 3
\f[C]%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] (only on Windows)
.IP "3." 3
\f[C]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] (on all systems, including
Windows)
.IP "4." 3
\f[C]\[ti]/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] (see below for explanation of
\[ti] symbol)
.IP "5." 3
\f[C]\[ti]/.rclone.conf\f[R]
.PP
If no existing configuration file is found, then a new one will be
created in the following location:
.IP \[bu] 2
On Windows: Location 2 listed above, except in the unlikely event that
\f[C]APPDATA\f[R] is not defined, then location 4 is used instead.
.IP \[bu] 2
On Unix: Location 3 if \f[C]XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[R] is defined, else
location 4.
.IP \[bu] 2
Fallback to location 5 (on all OS), when the rclone directory cannot be
created, but if also a home directory was not found then path
\f[C].rclone.conf\f[R] relative to current working directory will be
used as a final resort.
.PP
The \f[C]\[ti]\f[R] symbol in paths above represent the home directory
of the current user on any OS, and the value is defined as following:
.IP \[bu] 2
On Windows: \f[C]%HOME%\f[R] if defined, else \f[C]%USERPROFILE%\f[R],
or else \f[C]%HOMEDRIVE%\[rs]%HOMEPATH%\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
On Unix: \f[C]$HOME\f[R] if defined, else by looking up current user in
OS-specific user database (e.g.
passwd file), or else use the result from shell command
\f[C]cd && pwd\f[R].
.PP
If you run \f[C]rclone config file\f[R] you will see where the default
location is for you.
.PP
The fact that an existing file \f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] in the same
directory as the rclone executable is always preferred, means that it is
easy to run in \[dq]portable\[dq] mode by downloading rclone executable
to a writable directory and then create an empty file
\f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] in the same directory.
.PP
If the location is set to empty string \f[C]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R] or path to a
file with name \f[C]notfound\f[R], or the os null device represented by
value \f[C]NUL\f[R] on Windows and \f[C]/dev/null\f[R] on Unix systems,
then rclone will keep the config file in memory only.
.PP
The file format is basic
INI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Format): Sections of text,
led by a \f[C][section]\f[R] header and followed by \f[C]key=value\f[R]
entries on separate lines.
In rclone each remote is represented by its own section, where the
section name defines the name of the remote.
Options are specified as the \f[C]key=value\f[R] entries, where the key
is the option name without the \f[C]--backend-\f[R] prefix, in lowercase
and with \f[C]_\f[R] instead of \f[C]-\f[R].
E.g.
option \f[C]--mega-hard-delete\f[R] corresponds to key
\f[C]hard_delete\f[R].
Only backend options can be specified.
A special, and required, key \f[C]type\f[R] identifies the storage
system (https://rclone.org/overview/), where the value is the internal
lowercase name as returned by command \f[C]rclone help backends\f[R].
Comments are indicated by \f[C];\f[R] or \f[C]#\f[R] at the beginning of
a line.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[megaremote]
type = mega
user = you\[at]example.com
pass = PDPcQVVjVtzFY-GTdDFozqBhTdsPg3qH
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that passwords are in
obscured (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/) form.
Also, many storage systems uses token-based authentication instead of
passwords, and this requires additional steps.
It is easier, and safer, to use the interactive command
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] instead of manually editing the configuration
file.
.PP
The configuration file will typically contain login information, and
should therefore have restricted permissions so that only the current
user can read it.
Rclone tries to ensure this when it writes the file.
You may also choose to encrypt the file.
.PP
When token-based authentication are used, the configuration file must be
writable, because rclone needs to update the tokens inside it.
.SS --contimeout=TIME
.PP
Set the connection timeout.
This should be in go time format which looks like \f[C]5s\f[R] for 5
seconds, \f[C]10m\f[R] for 10 minutes, or \f[C]3h30m\f[R].
.PP
The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.
It is \f[C]1m\f[R] by default.
.SS --copy-dest=DIR
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R] DIR is
checked in addition to the destination for files.
If a file identical to the source is found that file is server-side
copied from DIR to the destination.
This is useful for incremental backup.
.PP
The remote in use must support server-side copy and you must use the
same remote as the destination of the sync.
The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
See \f[C]--compare-dest\f[R] and \f[C]--backup-dir\f[R].
.SS --dedupe-mode MODE
.PP
Mode to run dedupe command in.
One of \f[C]interactive\f[R], \f[C]skip\f[R], \f[C]first\f[R],
\f[C]newest\f[R], \f[C]oldest\f[R], \f[C]rename\f[R].
The default is \f[C]interactive\f[R].
See the dedupe command for more information as to what these options
mean.
.SS --disable FEATURE,FEATURE,...
.PP
This disables a comma separated list of optional features.
For example to disable server-side move and server-side copy use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--disable move,copy
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The features can be put in any case.
.PP
To see a list of which features can be disabled use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--disable help
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the overview features (https://rclone.org/overview/#features) and
optional features (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) to
get an idea of which feature does what.
.PP
This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
(e.g.
Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to 100
GiB/day).
.SS --disable-http2
.PP
This stops rclone from trying to use HTTP/2 if available.
This can sometimes speed up transfers due to a problem in the Go
standard library (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37373).
.SS --dscp VALUE
.PP
Specify a DSCP value or name to use in connections.
This could help QoS system to identify traffic class.
BE, EF, DF, LE, CSx and AFxx are allowed.
.PP
See the description of differentiated
services (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services) to get
an idea of this field.
Setting this to 1 (LE) to identify the flow to SCAVENGER class can avoid
occupying too much bandwidth in a network with DiffServ support (RFC
8622 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8622)).
.PP
For example, if you configured QoS on router to handle LE properly.
Running:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --dscp LE from:/from to:/to
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
would make the priority lower than usual internet flows.
.PP
This option has no effect on Windows (see
golang/go#42728 (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42728)).
.SS -n, --dry-run
.PP
Do a trial run with no permanent changes.
Use this to see what rclone would do without actually doing it.
Useful when setting up the \f[C]sync\f[R] command which deletes files in
the destination.
.SS --expect-continue-timeout=TIME
.PP
This specifies the amount of time to wait for a server\[aq]s first
response headers after fully writing the request headers if the request
has an \[dq]Expect: 100-continue\[dq] header.
Not all backends support using this.
.PP
Zero means no timeout and causes the body to be sent immediately,
without waiting for the server to approve.
This time does not include the time to send the request header.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1s\f[R].
Set to \f[C]0\f[R] to disable.
.SS --error-on-no-transfer
.PP
By default, rclone will exit with return code 0 if there were no errors.
.PP
This option allows rclone to return exit code 9 if no files were
transferred between the source and destination.
This allows using rclone in scripts, and triggering follow-on actions if
data was copied, or skipping if not.
.PP
NB: Enabling this option turns a usually non-fatal error into a
potentially fatal one - please check and adjust your scripts
accordingly!
.SS --fs-cache-expire-duration=TIME
.PP
When using rclone via the API rclone caches created remotes for 5
minutes by default in the \[dq]fs cache\[dq].
This means that if you do repeated actions on the same remote then
rclone won\[aq]t have to build it again from scratch, which makes it
more efficient.
.PP
This flag sets the time that the remotes are cached for.
If you set it to \f[C]0\f[R] (or negative) then rclone won\[aq]t cache
the remotes at all.
.PP
Note that if you use some flags, eg \f[C]--backup-dir\f[R] and if this
is set to \f[C]0\f[R] rclone may build two remotes (one for the source
or destination and one for the \f[C]--backup-dir\f[R] where it may have
only built one before.
.SS --fs-cache-expire-interval=TIME
.PP
This controls how often rclone checks for cached remotes to expire.
See the \f[C]--fs-cache-expire-duration\f[R] documentation above for
more info.
The default is 60s, set to 0 to disable expiry.
.SS --header
.PP
Add an HTTP header for all transactions.
The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.
.PP
If you want to add headers only for uploads use
\f[C]--header-upload\f[R] and if you want to add headers only for
downloads use \f[C]--header-download\f[R].
.PP
This flag is supported for all HTTP based backends even those not
supported by \f[C]--header-upload\f[R] and \f[C]--header-download\f[R]
so may be used as a workaround for those with care.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:test --header \[dq]X-Rclone: Foo\[dq] --header \[dq]X-LetMeIn: Yes\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS --header-download
.PP
Add an HTTP header for all download transactions.
The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync -i s3:test/src \[ti]/dst --header-download \[dq]X-Amz-Meta-Test: Foo\[dq] --header-download \[dq]X-Amz-Meta-Test2: Bar\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the GitHub issue here (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59)
for currently supported backends.
.SS --header-upload
.PP
Add an HTTP header for all upload transactions.
The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync -i \[ti]/src s3:test/dst --header-upload \[dq]Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\[aq]cool.html\[aq]\[dq] --header-upload \[dq]X-Amz-Meta-Test: FooBar\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the GitHub issue here (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59)
for currently supported backends.
.SS --human-readable
.PP
Rclone commands output values for sizes (e.g.
number of bytes) and counts (e.g.
number of files) either as \f[I]raw\f[R] numbers, or in
\f[I]human-readable\f[R] format.
.PP
In human-readable format the values are scaled to larger units,
indicated with a suffix shown after the value, and rounded to three
decimals.
Rclone consistently uses binary units (powers of 2) for sizes and
decimal units (powers of 10) for counts.
The unit prefix for size is according to IEC standard notation, e.g.
\f[C]Ki\f[R] for kibi.
Used with byte unit, \f[C]1 KiB\f[R] means 1024 Byte.
In list type of output, only the unit prefix appended to the value (e.g.
\f[C]9.762Ki\f[R]), while in more textual output the full unit is shown
(e.g.
\f[C]9.762 KiB\f[R]).
For counts the SI standard notation is used, e.g.
prefix \f[C]k\f[R] for kilo.
Used with file counts, \f[C]1k\f[R] means 1000 files.
.PP
The various list (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ls/) commands
output raw numbers by default.
Option \f[C]--human-readable\f[R] will make them output values in
human-readable format instead (with the short unit prefix).
.PP
The about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/) command outputs
human-readable by default, with a command-specific option
\f[C]--full\f[R] to output the raw numbers instead.
.PP
Command size (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_size/) outputs both
human-readable and raw numbers in the same output.
.PP
The tree (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_tree/) command also
considers \f[C]--human-readable\f[R], but it will not use the exact same
notation as the other commands: It rounds to one decimal, and uses
single letter suffix, e.g.
\f[C]K\f[R] instead of \f[C]Ki\f[R].
The reason for this is that it relies on an external library.
.PP
The interactive command ncdu (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ncdu/)
shows human-readable by default, and responds to key \f[C]u\f[R] for
toggling human-readable format.
.SS --ignore-case-sync
.PP
Using this option will cause rclone to ignore the case of the files when
synchronizing so files will not be copied/synced when the existing
filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.
.SS --ignore-checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files
match, and give an error \[dq]corrupted on transfer\[dq] if they
don\[aq]t.
.PP
You can use this option to skip that check.
You should only use it if you have had the \[dq]corrupted on
transfer\[dq] error message and you are sure you might want to transfer
potentially corrupted data.
.SS --ignore-existing
.PP
Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files that
exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.
.PP
While this isn\[aq]t a generally recommended option, it can be useful in
cases where your files change due to encryption.
However, it cannot correct partial transfers in case a transfer was
interrupted.
.PP
When performing a \f[C]move\f[R]/\f[C]moveto\f[R] command, this flag
will leave skipped files in the source location unchanged when a file
with the same name exists on the destination.
.SS --ignore-size
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the modification time.
If \f[C]--checksum\f[R] is set then it only checks the checksum.
.PP
It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same after
transfer.
.PP
This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see
#399 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/399) for more info).
.SS -I, --ignore-times
.PP
Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all files
regardless of the state of files on the destination.
.PP
Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same modification
time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if using
\f[C]--checksum\f[R]).
.SS --immutable
.PP
Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
modification.
.PP
With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
but existing files will never be updated.
If an existing file does not match between the source and destination,
rclone will give the error
\f[C]Source and destination exist but do not match: immutable file modified\f[R].
.PP
Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g.
\f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R], \f[C]move\f[R]) are affected by this
behavior, and only modification is disallowed.
Files may still be deleted explicitly (e.g.
\f[C]delete\f[R], \f[C]purge\f[R]) or implicitly (e.g.
\f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]move\f[R]).
Use \f[C]copy --immutable\f[R] if it is desired to avoid deletion as
well as modification.
.PP
This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable or
append-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
implies corruption and should not be propagated.
.SS -i / --interactive
.PP
This flag can be used to tell rclone that you wish a manual confirmation
before destructive operations.
.PP
It is \f[B]recommended\f[R] that you use this flag while learning rclone
especially with \f[C]rclone sync\f[R].
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone delete -i /tmp/dir
rclone: delete \[dq]important-file.txt\[dq]?
y) Yes, this is OK (default)
n) No, skip this
s) Skip all delete operations with no more questions
!) Do all delete operations with no more questions
q) Exit rclone now.
y/n/s/!/q> n
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The options mean
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]y\f[R]: \f[B]Yes\f[R], this operation should go ahead.
You can also press Return for this to happen.
You\[aq]ll be asked every time unless you choose \f[C]s\f[R] or
\f[C]!\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]n\f[R]: \f[B]No\f[R], do not do this operation.
You\[aq]ll be asked every time unless you choose \f[C]s\f[R] or
\f[C]!\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]s\f[R]: \f[B]Skip\f[R] all the following operations of this type
with no more questions.
This takes effect until rclone exits.
If there are any different kind of operations you\[aq]ll be prompted for
them.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]!\f[R]: \f[B]Do all\f[R] the following operations with no more
questions.
Useful if you\[aq]ve decided that you don\[aq]t mind rclone doing that
kind of operation.
This takes effect until rclone exits .
If there are any different kind of operations you\[aq]ll be prompted for
them.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]q\f[R]: \f[B]Quit\f[R] rclone now, just in case!
.SS --leave-root
.PP
During rmdirs it will not remove root directory, even if it\[aq]s empty.
.SS --log-file=FILE
.PP
Log all of rclone\[aq]s output to FILE.
This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination
with the \f[C]-v\f[R] flag.
See the Logging section for more info.
.PP
If FILE exists then rclone will append to it.
.PP
Note that if you are using the \f[C]logrotate\f[R] program to manage
rclone\[aq]s logs, then you should use the \f[C]copytruncate\f[R] option
as rclone doesn\[aq]t have a signal to rotate logs.
.SS --log-format LIST
.PP
Comma separated list of log format options.
Accepted options are \f[C]date\f[R], \f[C]time\f[R],
\f[C]microseconds\f[R], \f[C]pid\f[R], \f[C]longfile\f[R],
\f[C]shortfile\f[R], \f[C]UTC\f[R].
Any other keywords will be silently ignored.
\f[C]pid\f[R] will tag log messages with process identifier which useful
with \f[C]rclone mount --daemon\f[R].
Other accepted options are explained in the go
documentation (https://pkg.go.dev/log#pkg-constants).
The default log format is \[dq]\f[C]date\f[R],\f[C]time\f[R]\[dq].
.SS --log-level LEVEL
.PP
This sets the log level for rclone.
The default log level is \f[C]NOTICE\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]DEBUG\f[R] is equivalent to \f[C]-vv\f[R].
It outputs lots of debug info - useful for bug reports and really
finding out what rclone is doing.
.PP
\f[C]INFO\f[R] is equivalent to \f[C]-v\f[R].
It outputs information about each transfer and prints stats once a
minute by default.
.PP
\f[C]NOTICE\f[R] is the default log level if no logging flags are
supplied.
It outputs very little when things are working normally.
It outputs warnings and significant events.
.PP
\f[C]ERROR\f[R] is equivalent to \f[C]-q\f[R].
It only outputs error messages.
.SS --use-json-log
.PP
This switches the log format to JSON for rclone.
The fields of json log are level, msg, source, time.
.SS --low-level-retries NUMBER
.PP
This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.
.PP
A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation - typically one
HTTP request.
This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for example.
You will see low level retries in the log with the \f[C]-v\f[R] flag.
.PP
This shouldn\[aq]t need to be changed from the default in normal
operations.
However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish to reduce
the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the
\f[C]--retries\f[R] flag) quicker.
.PP
Disable low level retries with \f[C]--low-level-retries 1\f[R].
.SS --max-backlog=N
.PP
This is the maximum allowable backlog of files in a sync/copy/move
queued for being checked or transferred.
.PP
This can be set arbitrarily large.
It will only use memory when the queue is in use.
Note that it will use in the order of N KiB of memory when the backlog
is in use.
.PP
Setting this large allows rclone to calculate how many files are pending
more accurately, give a more accurate estimated finish time and make
\f[C]--order-by\f[R] work more accurately.
.PP
Setting this small will make rclone more synchronous to the listings of
the remote which may be desirable.
.PP
Setting this to a negative number will make the backlog as large as
possible.
.SS --max-delete=N
.PP
This tells rclone not to delete more than N files.
If that limit is exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and
rclone will stop the operation in progress.
.SS --max-depth=N
.PP
This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.
.PP
So if you do \f[C]rclone --max-depth 1 ls remote:path\f[R] you will see
only the files in the top level directory.
Using \f[C]--max-depth 2\f[R] means you will see all the files in first
two directory levels and so on.
.PP
For historical reasons the \f[C]lsd\f[R] command defaults to using a
\f[C]--max-depth\f[R] of 1 - you can override this with the command line
flag.
.PP
You can use this command to disable recursion (with
\f[C]--max-depth 1\f[R]).
.PP
Note that if you use this with \f[C]sync\f[R] and
\f[C]--delete-excluded\f[R] the files not recursed through are
considered excluded and will be deleted on the destination.
Test first with \f[C]--dry-run\f[R] if you are not sure what will
happen.
.SS --max-duration=TIME
.PP
Rclone will stop scheduling new transfers when it has run for the
duration specified.
.PP
Defaults to off.
.PP
When the limit is reached any existing transfers will complete.
.PP
Rclone won\[aq]t exit with an error if the transfer limit is reached.
.SS --max-transfer=SIZE
.PP
Rclone will stop transferring when it has reached the size specified.
Defaults to off.
.PP
When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.
.PP
Rclone will exit with exit code 8 if the transfer limit is reached.
.SS --cutoff-mode=hard|soft|cautious
.PP
This modifies the behavior of \f[C]--max-transfer\f[R] Defaults to
\f[C]--cutoff-mode=hard\f[R].
.PP
Specifying \f[C]--cutoff-mode=hard\f[R] will stop transferring
immediately when Rclone reaches the limit.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]--cutoff-mode=soft\f[R] will stop starting new transfers
when Rclone reaches the limit.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]--cutoff-mode=cautious\f[R] will try to prevent Rclone
from reaching the limit.
.SS --modify-window=TIME
.PP
When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1ns\f[R] unless this is overridden by a remote.
For example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
\f[C]1s\f[R] by default.
.PP
This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.
.SS --multi-thread-cutoff=SIZE
.PP
When downloading files to the local backend above this size, rclone will
use multiple threads to download the file (default 250M).
.PP
Rclone preallocates the file (using
\f[C]fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE)\f[R] on unix or
\f[C]NTSetInformationFile\f[R] on Windows both of which takes no time)
then each thread writes directly into the file at the correct place.
This means that rclone won\[aq]t create fragmented or sparse files and
there won\[aq]t be any assembly time at the end of the transfer.
.PP
The number of threads used to download is controlled by
\f[C]--multi-thread-streams\f[R].
.PP
Use \f[C]-vv\f[R] if you wish to see info about the threads.
.PP
This will work with the \f[C]sync\f[R]/\f[C]copy\f[R]/\f[C]move\f[R]
commands and friends \f[C]copyto\f[R]/\f[C]moveto\f[R].
Multi thread downloads will be used with \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] and
\f[C]rclone serve\f[R] if \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] is set to
\f[C]writes\f[R] or above.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] that this \f[B]only\f[R] works for a local destination but
will work with any source.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] that multi thread copies are disabled for local to local
copies as they are faster without unless
\f[C]--multi-thread-streams\f[R] is set explicitly.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] on Windows using multi-thread downloads will cause the
resulting files to be
sparse (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file).
Use \f[C]--local-no-sparse\f[R] to disable sparse files (which may cause
long delays at the start of downloads) or disable multi-thread downloads
with \f[C]--multi-thread-streams 0\f[R]
.SS --multi-thread-streams=N
.PP
When using multi thread downloads (see above
\f[C]--multi-thread-cutoff\f[R]) this sets the maximum number of streams
to use.
Set to \f[C]0\f[R] to disable multi thread downloads (Default 4).
.PP
Exactly how many streams rclone uses for the download depends on the
size of the file.
To calculate the number of download streams Rclone divides the size of
the file by the \f[C]--multi-thread-cutoff\f[R] and rounds up, up to the
maximum set with \f[C]--multi-thread-streams\f[R].
.PP
So if \f[C]--multi-thread-cutoff 250M\f[R] and
\f[C]--multi-thread-streams 4\f[R] are in effect (the defaults):
.IP \[bu] 2
0..250 MiB files will be downloaded with 1 stream
.IP \[bu] 2
250..500 MiB files will be downloaded with 2 streams
.IP \[bu] 2
500..750 MiB files will be downloaded with 3 streams
.IP \[bu] 2
750+ MiB files will be downloaded with 4 streams
.SS --no-check-dest
.PP
The \f[C]--no-check-dest\f[R] can be used with \f[C]move\f[R] or
\f[C]copy\f[R] and it causes rclone not to check the destination at all
when copying files.
.PP
This means that:
.IP \[bu] 2
the destination is not listed minimising the API calls
.IP \[bu] 2
files are always transferred
.IP \[bu] 2
this can cause duplicates on remotes which allow it (e.g.
Google Drive)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--retries 1\f[R] is recommended otherwise you\[aq]ll transfer
everything again on a retry
.PP
This flag is useful to minimise the transactions if you know that none
of the files are on the destination.
.PP
This is a specialized flag which should be ignored by most users!
.SS --no-gzip-encoding
.PP
Don\[aq]t set \f[C]Accept-Encoding: gzip\f[R].
This means that rclone won\[aq]t ask the server for compressed files
automatically.
Useful if you\[aq]ve set the server to return files with
\f[C]Content-Encoding: gzip\f[R] but you uploaded compressed files.
.PP
There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.
.SS --no-traverse
.PP
The \f[C]--no-traverse\f[R] flag controls whether the destination file
system is traversed when using the \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R]
commands.
\f[C]--no-traverse\f[R] is not compatible with \f[C]sync\f[R] and will
be ignored if you supply it with \f[C]sync\f[R].
.PP
If you are only copying a small number of files (or are filtering most
of the files) and/or have a large number of files on the destination
then \f[C]--no-traverse\f[R] will stop rclone listing the destination
and save time.
.PP
However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files under consideration haven\[aq]t
changed and won\[aq]t need copying then you shouldn\[aq]t use
\f[C]--no-traverse\f[R].
.PP
See rclone copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) for an
example of how to use it.
.SS --no-unicode-normalization
.PP
Don\[aq]t normalize unicode characters in filenames during the sync
routine.
.PP
Sometimes, an operating system will store filenames containing unicode
parts in their decomposed form (particularly macOS).
Some cloud storage systems will then recompose the unicode, resulting in
duplicate files if the data is ever copied back to a local filesystem.
.PP
Using this flag will disable that functionality, treating each unicode
character as unique.
For example, by default e\[u0301] and \['e] will be normalized into the
same character.
With \f[C]--no-unicode-normalization\f[R] they will be treated as unique
characters.
.SS --no-update-modtime
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update modification times of
remote files if they are incorrect as it would normally.
.PP
This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(e.g.
the Google Drive client).
.SS --order-by string
.PP
The \f[C]--order-by\f[R] flag controls the order in which files in the
backlog are processed in \f[C]rclone sync\f[R], \f[C]rclone copy\f[R]
and \f[C]rclone move\f[R].
.PP
The order by string is constructed like this.
The first part describes what aspect is being measured:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]size\f[R] - order by the size of the files
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]name\f[R] - order by the full path of the files
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]modtime\f[R] - order by the modification date of the files
.PP
This can have a modifier appended with a comma:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ascending\f[R] or \f[C]asc\f[R] - order so that the smallest (or
oldest) is processed first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]descending\f[R] or \f[C]desc\f[R] - order so that the largest (or
newest) is processed first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]mixed\f[R] - order so that the smallest is processed first for some
threads and the largest for others
.PP
If the modifier is \f[C]mixed\f[R] then it can have an optional
percentage (which defaults to \f[C]50\f[R]), e.g.
\f[C]size,mixed,25\f[R] which means that 25% of the threads should be
taking the smallest items and 75% the largest.
The threads which take the smallest first will always take the smallest
first and likewise the largest first threads.
The \f[C]mixed\f[R] mode can be useful to minimise the transfer time
when you are transferring a mixture of large and small files - the large
files are guaranteed upload threads and bandwidth and the small files
will be processed continuously.
.PP
If no modifier is supplied then the order is \f[C]ascending\f[R].
.PP
For example
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--order-by size,desc\f[R] - send the largest files first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--order-by modtime,ascending\f[R] - send the oldest files first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--order-by name\f[R] - send the files with alphabetically by path
first
.PP
If the \f[C]--order-by\f[R] flag is not supplied or it is supplied with
an empty string then the default ordering will be used which is as
scanned.
With \f[C]--checkers 1\f[R] this is mostly alphabetical, however with
the default \f[C]--checkers 8\f[R] it is somewhat random.
.SS Limitations
.PP
The \f[C]--order-by\f[R] flag does not do a separate pass over the data.
This means that it may transfer some files out of the order specified if
.IP \[bu] 2
there are no files in the backlog or the source has not been fully
scanned yet
.IP \[bu] 2
there are more than --max-backlog files in the backlog
.PP
Rclone will do its best to transfer the best file it has so in practice
this should not cause a problem.
Think of \f[C]--order-by\f[R] as being more of a best efforts flag
rather than a perfect ordering.
.PP
If you want perfect ordering then you will need to specify --check-first
which will find all the files which need transferring first before
transferring any.
.SS --password-command SpaceSepList
.PP
This flag supplies a program which should supply the config password
when run.
This is an alternative to rclone prompting for the password or setting
the \f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] variable.
.PP
The argument to this should be a command with a space separated list of
arguments.
If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose it in
\f[C]\[dq]\f[R], if you want a literal \f[C]\[dq]\f[R] in an argument
then enclose the argument in \f[C]\[dq]\f[R] and double the
\f[C]\[dq]\f[R].
See CSV encoding (https://godoc.org/encoding/csv) for more info.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--password-command echo hello
--password-command echo \[dq]hello with space\[dq]
--password-command echo \[dq]hello with \[dq]\[dq]quotes\[dq]\[dq] and space\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the Configuration Encryption for more info.
.PP
See a Windows PowerShell example on the
Wiki (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Windows-Powershell-use-rclone-password-command-for-Config-file-password).
.SS -P, --progress
.PP
This flag makes rclone update the stats in a static block in the
terminal providing a realtime overview of the transfer.
.PP
Any log messages will scroll above the static block.
Log messages will push the static block down to the bottom of the
terminal where it will stay.
.PP
Normally this is updated every 500mS but this period can be overridden
with the \f[C]--stats\f[R] flag.
.PP
This can be used with the \f[C]--stats-one-line\f[R] flag for a simpler
display.
.PP
Note: On Windows until this
bug (https://github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/issues/26) is fixed all
non-ASCII characters will be replaced with \f[C].\f[R] when
\f[C]--progress\f[R] is in use.
.SS --progress-terminal-title
.PP
This flag, when used with \f[C]-P/--progress\f[R], will print the string
\f[C]ETA: %s\f[R] to the terminal title.
.SS -q, --quiet
.PP
This flag will limit rclone\[aq]s output to error messages only.
.SS --refresh-times
.PP
The \f[C]--refresh-times\f[R] flag can be used to update modification
times of existing files when they are out of sync on backends which
don\[aq]t support hashes.
.PP
This is useful if you uploaded files with the incorrect timestamps and
you now wish to correct them.
.PP
This flag is \f[B]only\f[R] useful for destinations which don\[aq]t
support hashes (e.g.
\f[C]crypt\f[R]).
.PP
This can be used any of the sync commands \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R]
or \f[C]move\f[R].
.PP
To use this flag you will need to be doing a modification time sync (so
not using \f[C]--size-only\f[R] or \f[C]--checksum\f[R]).
The flag will have no effect when using \f[C]--size-only\f[R] or
\f[C]--checksum\f[R].
.PP
If this flag is used when rclone comes to upload a file it will check to
see if there is an existing file on the destination.
If this file matches the source with size (and checksum if available)
but has a differing timestamp then instead of re-uploading it, rclone
will update the timestamp on the destination file.
If the checksum does not match rclone will upload the new file.
If the checksum is absent (e.g.
on a \f[C]crypt\f[R] backend) then rclone will update the timestamp.
.PP
Note that some remotes can\[aq]t set the modification time without
re-uploading the file so this flag is less useful on them.
.PP
Normally if you are doing a modification time sync rclone will update
modification times without \f[C]--refresh-times\f[R] provided that the
remote supports checksums \f[B]and\f[R] the checksums match on the file.
However if the checksums are absent then rclone will upload the file
rather than setting the timestamp as this is the safe behaviour.
.SS --retries int
.PP
Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).
.PP
Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the files
which didn\[aq]t get transferred because of errors.
.PP
Disable retries with \f[C]--retries 1\f[R].
.SS --retries-sleep=TIME
.PP
This sets the interval between each retry specified by
\f[C]--retries\f[R]
.PP
The default is \f[C]0\f[R].
Use \f[C]0\f[R] to disable.
.SS --size-only
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the size.
.PP
This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn\[aq]t set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.
.SS --stats=TIME
.PP
Commands which transfer data (\f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R],
\f[C]copyto\f[R], \f[C]move\f[R], \f[C]moveto\f[R]) will print data
transfer stats at regular intervals to show their progress.
.PP
This sets the interval.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1m\f[R].
Use \f[C]0\f[R] to disable.
.PP
If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats.
This can be useful when running other commands, \f[C]check\f[R] or
\f[C]mount\f[R] for example.
.PP
Stats are logged at \f[C]INFO\f[R] level by default which means they
won\[aq]t show at default log level \f[C]NOTICE\f[R].
Use \f[C]--stats-log-level NOTICE\f[R] or \f[C]-v\f[R] to make them
show.
See the Logging section for more info on log levels.
.PP
Note that on macOS you can send a SIGINFO (which is normally ctrl-T in
the terminal) to make the stats print immediately.
.SS --stats-file-name-length integer
.PP
By default, the \f[C]--stats\f[R] output will truncate file names and
paths longer than 40 characters.
This is equivalent to providing \f[C]--stats-file-name-length 40\f[R].
Use \f[C]--stats-file-name-length 0\f[R] to disable any truncation of
file names printed by stats.
.SS --stats-log-level string
.PP
Log level to show \f[C]--stats\f[R] output at.
This can be \f[C]DEBUG\f[R], \f[C]INFO\f[R], \f[C]NOTICE\f[R], or
\f[C]ERROR\f[R].
The default is \f[C]INFO\f[R].
This means at the default level of logging which is \f[C]NOTICE\f[R] the
stats won\[aq]t show - if you want them to then use
\f[C]--stats-log-level NOTICE\f[R].
See the Logging section for more info on log levels.
.SS --stats-one-line
.PP
When this is specified, rclone condenses the stats into a single line
showing the most important stats only.
.SS --stats-one-line-date
.PP
When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and
prepends the display with a date string.
The default is \f[C]2006/01/02 15:04:05 -\f[R]
.SS --stats-one-line-date-format
.PP
When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and
prepends the display with a user-supplied date string.
The date string MUST be enclosed in quotes.
Follow golang specs (https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format) for date
formatting syntax.
.SS --stats-unit=bits|bytes
.PP
By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes per second.
.PP
This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits per second.
.PP
Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.
.PP
The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit.
So 1 Mbit/s equals 1,048,576 bit/s and not 1,000,000 bit/s.
.PP
The default is \f[C]bytes\f[R].
.SS --suffix=SUFFIX
.PP
When using \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] or \f[C]move\f[R] any files
which would have been overwritten or deleted will have the suffix added
to them.
If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added),
then it will be overwritten.
.PP
The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.
.PP
This is for use with files to add the suffix in the current directory or
with \f[C]--backup-dir\f[R].
See \f[C]--backup-dir\f[R] for more info.
.PP
For example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy -i /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
will copy \f[C]/path/to/local\f[R] to \f[C]remote:current\f[R], but for
any files which would have been updated or deleted have .bak added.
.PP
If using \f[C]rclone sync\f[R] with \f[C]--suffix\f[R] and without
\f[C]--backup-dir\f[R] then it is recommended to put a filter rule in
excluding the suffix otherwise the \f[C]sync\f[R] will delete the backup
files.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync -i /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak --exclude \[dq]*.bak\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS --suffix-keep-extension
.PP
When using \f[C]--suffix\f[R], setting this causes rclone put the SUFFIX
before the extension of the files that it backs up rather than after.
.PP
So let\[aq]s say we had \f[C]--suffix -2019-01-01\f[R], without the flag
\f[C]file.txt\f[R] would be backed up to \f[C]file.txt-2019-01-01\f[R]
and with the flag it would be backed up to
\f[C]file-2019-01-01.txt\f[R].
This can be helpful to make sure the suffixed files can still be opened.
.SS --syslog
.PP
On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.
.PP
This can be useful for running rclone in a script or
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R].
.SS --syslog-facility string
.PP
If using \f[C]--syslog\f[R] this sets the syslog facility (e.g.
\f[C]KERN\f[R], \f[C]USER\f[R]).
See \f[C]man syslog\f[R] for a list of possible facilities.
The default facility is \f[C]DAEMON\f[R].
.SS --temp-dir=DIR
.PP
Specify the directory rclone will use for temporary files, to override
the default.
Make sure the directory exists and have accessible permissions.
.PP
By default the operating system\[aq]s temp directory will be used: - On
Unix systems, \f[C]$TMPDIR\f[R] if non-empty, else \f[C]/tmp\f[R].
- On Windows, the first non-empty value from \f[C]%TMP%\f[R],
\f[C]%TEMP%\f[R], \f[C]%USERPROFILE%\f[R], or the Windows directory.
.PP
When overriding the default with this option, the specified path will be
set as value of environment variable \f[C]TMPDIR\f[R] on Unix systems
and \f[C]TMP\f[R] and \f[C]TEMP\f[R] on Windows.
.PP
You can use the config
paths (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/) command to see
the current value.
.SS --tpslimit float
.PP
Limit transactions per second to this number.
Default is 0 which is used to mean unlimited transactions per second.
.PP
A transaction is roughly defined as an API call; its exact meaning will
depend on the backend.
For HTTP based backends it is an HTTP PUT/GET/POST/etc and its response.
For FTP/SFTP it is a round trip transaction over TCP.
.PP
For example, to limit rclone to 10 transactions per second use
\f[C]--tpslimit 10\f[R], or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use
\f[C]--tpslimit 0.5\f[R].
.PP
Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is
causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (e.g.
getting you banned or rate limited).
.PP
This can be very useful for \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] to control the
behaviour of applications using it.
.PP
This limit applies to all HTTP based backends and to the FTP and SFTP
backends.
It does not apply to the local backend or the Storj backend.
.PP
See also \f[C]--tpslimit-burst\f[R].
.SS --tpslimit-burst int
.PP
Max burst of transactions for \f[C]--tpslimit\f[R] (default
\f[C]1\f[R]).
.PP
Normally \f[C]--tpslimit\f[R] will do exactly the number of transaction
per second specified.
However if you supply \f[C]--tps-burst\f[R] then rclone can save up some
transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up to the parameter
supplied.
.PP
For example if you provide \f[C]--tpslimit-burst 10\f[R] then if rclone
has been idle for more than 10*\f[C]--tpslimit\f[R] then it can do 10
transactions very quickly before they are limited again.
.PP
This may be used to increase performance of \f[C]--tpslimit\f[R] without
changing the long term average number of transactions per second.
.SS --track-renames
.PP
By default, rclone doesn\[aq]t keep track of renamed files, so if you
rename a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the
old file on the remote and upload a new copy.
.PP
If you use this flag, and the remote supports server-side copy or
server-side move, and the source and destination have a compatible hash,
then this will track renames during \f[C]sync\f[R] operations and
perform renaming server-side.
.PP
Files will be matched by size and hash - if both match then a rename
will be considered.
.PP
If the destination does not support server-side copy or move, rclone
will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message
to the console.
.PP
Encrypted destinations are not currently supported by
\f[C]--track-renames\f[R] if \f[C]--track-renames-strategy\f[R] includes
\f[C]hash\f[R].
.PP
Note that \f[C]--track-renames\f[R] is incompatible with
\f[C]--no-traverse\f[R] and that it uses extra memory to keep track of
all the rename candidates.
.PP
Note also that \f[C]--track-renames\f[R] is incompatible with
\f[C]--delete-before\f[R] and will select \f[C]--delete-after\f[R]
instead of \f[C]--delete-during\f[R].
.SS --track-renames-strategy (hash,modtime,leaf,size)
.PP
This option changes the matching criteria for \f[C]--track-renames\f[R].
.PP
The matching is controlled by a comma separated selection of these
tokens:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]modtime\f[R] - the modification time of the file - not supported on
all backends
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]hash\f[R] - the hash of the file contents - not supported on all
backends
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]leaf\f[R] - the name of the file not including its directory name
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]size\f[R] - the size of the file (this is always enabled)
.PP
So using \f[C]--track-renames-strategy modtime,leaf\f[R] would match
files based on modification time, the leaf of the file name and the size
only.
.PP
Using \f[C]--track-renames-strategy modtime\f[R] or \f[C]leaf\f[R] can
enable \f[C]--track-renames\f[R] support for encrypted destinations.
.PP
If nothing is specified, the default option is matching by
\f[C]hash\f[R]es.
.PP
Note that the \f[C]hash\f[R] strategy is not supported with encrypted
destinations.
.SS --delete-(before,during,after)
.PP
This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.
.PP
Specifying the value \f[C]--delete-before\f[R] will delete all files
present on the destination, but not on the source \f[I]before\f[R]
starting the transfer of any new or updated files.
This uses two passes through the file systems, one for the deletions and
one for the copies.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]--delete-during\f[R] will delete files while checking
and uploading files.
This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.
.PP
Specifying \f[C]--delete-after\f[R] (the default value) will delay
deletion of files until all new/updated files have been successfully
transferred.
The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted
after the copy pass has completed successfully.
The files to be deleted are held in memory so this mode may use more
memory.
This is the safest mode as it will only delete files if there have been
no errors subsequent to that.
If there have been errors before the deletions start then you will get
the message \f[C]not deleting files as there were IO errors\f[R].
.SS --fast-list
.PP
When doing anything which involves a directory listing (e.g.
\f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R], \f[C]ls\f[R] - in fact nearly every
command), rclone normally lists a directory and processes it before
using more directory lists to process any subdirectories.
This can be parallelised and works very quickly using the least amount
of memory.
.PP
However, some remotes have a way of listing all files beneath a
directory in one (or a small number) of transactions.
These tend to be the bucket-based remotes (e.g.
S3, B2, GCS, Swift, Hubic).
.PP
If you use the \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] flag then rclone will use this
method for listing directories.
This will have the following consequences for the listing:
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[B]will\f[R] use fewer transactions (important if you pay for them)
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[B]will\f[R] use more memory.
Rclone has to load the whole listing into memory.
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[I]may\f[R] be faster because it uses fewer transactions
.IP \[bu] 2
It \f[I]may\f[R] be slower because it can\[aq]t be parallelized
.PP
rclone should always give identical results with and without
\f[C]--fast-list\f[R].
.PP
If you pay for transactions and can fit your entire sync listing into
memory then \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] is recommended.
If you have a very big sync to do then don\[aq]t use
\f[C]--fast-list\f[R] otherwise you will run out of memory.
.PP
If you use \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] on a remote which doesn\[aq]t support
it, then rclone will just ignore it.
.SS --timeout=TIME
.PP
This sets the IO idle timeout.
If a transfer has started but then becomes idle for this long it is
considered broken and disconnected.
.PP
The default is \f[C]5m\f[R].
Set to \f[C]0\f[R] to disable.
.SS --transfers=N
.PP
The number of file transfers to run in parallel.
It can sometimes be useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote
is giving a lot of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and
a fast remote.
.PP
The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.
.PP
Look at --multi-thread-streams if you would like to control single file
transfers.
.SS -u, --update
.PP
This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination and
have a modified time that is newer than the source file.
.PP
This can be useful in avoiding needless transfers when transferring to a
remote which doesn\[aq]t support modification times directly (or when
using \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R] to avoid extra API calls) as it is
more accurate than a \f[C]--size-only\f[R] check and faster than using
\f[C]--checksum\f[R].
On such remotes (or when using \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R]) the time
checked will be the uploaded time.
.PP
If an existing destination file has a modification time older than the
source file\[aq]s, it will be updated if the sizes are different.
If the sizes are the same, it will be updated if the checksum is
different or not available.
.PP
If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window) to the source file\[aq]s, it will be updated
if the sizes are different.
The checksum will not be checked in this case unless the
\f[C]--checksum\f[R] flag is provided.
.PP
In all other cases the file will not be updated.
.PP
Consider using the \f[C]--modify-window\f[R] flag to compensate for time
skews between the source and the backend, for backends that do not
support mod times, and instead use uploaded times.
However, if the backend does not support checksums, note that
sync\[aq]ing or copying within the time skew window may still result in
additional transfers for safety.
.SS --use-mmap
.PP
If this flag is set then rclone will use anonymous memory allocated by
mmap on Unix based platforms and VirtualAlloc on Windows for its
transfer buffers (size controlled by \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R]).
Memory allocated like this does not go on the Go heap and can be
returned to the OS immediately when it is finished with.
.PP
If this flag is not set then rclone will allocate and free the buffers
using the Go memory allocator which may use more memory as memory pages
are returned less aggressively to the OS.
.PP
It is possible this does not work well on all platforms so it is
disabled by default; in the future it may be enabled by default.
.SS --use-server-modtime
.PP
Some object-store backends (e.g, Swift, S3) do not preserve file
modification times (modtime).
On these backends, rclone stores the original modtime as additional
metadata on the object.
By default it will make an API call to retrieve the metadata when the
modtime is needed by an operation.
.PP
Use this flag to disable the extra API call and rely instead on the
server\[aq]s modified time.
In cases such as a local to remote sync using \f[C]--update\f[R],
knowing the local file is newer than the time it was last uploaded to
the remote is sufficient.
In those cases, this flag can speed up the process and reduce the number
of API calls necessary.
.PP
Using this flag on a sync operation without also using
\f[C]--update\f[R] would cause all files modified at any time other than
the last upload time to be uploaded again, which is probably not what
you want.
.SS -v, -vv, --verbose
.PP
With \f[C]-v\f[R] rclone will tell you about each file that is
transferred and a small number of significant events.
.PP
With \f[C]-vv\f[R] rclone will become very verbose telling you about
every file it considers and transfers.
Please send bug reports with a log with this setting.
.SS -V, --version
.PP
Prints the version number
.SS SSL/TLS options
.PP
The outgoing SSL/TLS connections rclone makes can be controlled with
these options.
For example this can be very useful with the HTTP or WebDAV backends.
Rclone HTTP servers have their own set of configuration for SSL/TLS
which you can find in their documentation.
.SS --ca-cert string
.PP
This loads the PEM encoded certificate authority certificate and uses it
to verify the certificates of the servers rclone connects to.
.PP
If you have generated certificates signed with a local CA then you will
need this flag to connect to servers using those certificates.
.SS --client-cert string
.PP
This loads the PEM encoded client side certificate.
.PP
This is used for mutual TLS
authentication (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication).
.PP
The \f[C]--client-key\f[R] flag is required too when using this.
.SS --client-key string
.PP
This loads the PEM encoded client side private key used for mutual TLS
authentication.
Used in conjunction with \f[C]--client-cert\f[R].
.SS --no-check-certificate=true/false
.PP
\f[C]--no-check-certificate\f[R] controls whether a client verifies the
server\[aq]s certificate chain and host name.
If \f[C]--no-check-certificate\f[R] is true, TLS accepts any certificate
presented by the server and any host name in that certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
.PP
This option defaults to \f[C]false\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]This should be used only for testing.\f[R]
.SS Configuration Encryption
.PP
Your configuration file contains information for logging in to your
cloud services.
This means that you should keep your \f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] file in a
secure location.
.PP
If you are in an environment where that isn\[aq]t possible, you can add
a password to your configuration.
This means that you will have to supply the password every time you
start rclone.
.PP
To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute
\f[C]rclone config\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
>rclone config
Current remotes:

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/s/q>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Go into \f[C]s\f[R], Set configuration password:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
e/n/d/s/q> s
Your configuration is not encrypted.
If you add a password, you will protect your login information to cloud services.
a) Add Password
q) Quit to main menu
a/q> a
Enter NEW configuration password:
password:
Confirm NEW password:
password:
Password set
Your configuration is encrypted.
c) Change Password
u) Unencrypt configuration
q) Quit to main menu
c/u/q>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone you
will have to supply the password.
See below for details.
In the same menu, you can change the password or completely remove
encryption from your configuration.
.PP
There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.
.PP
rclone uses nacl
secretbox (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) which
in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate your
configuration with secret-key cryptography.
The password is SHA-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox.
The hashed password is not stored.
.PP
While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing your
encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.
.PP
If it is safe in your environment, you can set the
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] environment variable to contain your
password, in which case it will be used for decrypting the
configuration.
.PP
You can set this for a session from a script.
For unix like systems save this to a file called
\f[C]set-rclone-password\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#!/bin/echo Source this file don\[aq]t run it

read -s RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then source the file when you want to use it.
From the shell you would do \f[C]source set-rclone-password\f[R].
It will then ask you for the password and set it in the environment
variable.
.PP
An alternate means of supplying the password is to provide a script
which will retrieve the password and print on standard output.
This script should have a fully specified path name and not rely on any
environment variables.
The script is supplied either via
\f[C]--password-command=\[dq]...\[dq]\f[R] command line argument or via
the \f[C]RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND\f[R] environment variable.
.PP
One useful example of this is using the \f[C]passwordstore\f[R]
application to retrieve the password:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND=\[dq]pass rclone/config\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If the \f[C]passwordstore\f[R] password manager holds the password for
the rclone configuration, using the script method means the password is
primarily protected by the \f[C]passwordstore\f[R] system, and is never
embedded in the clear in scripts, nor available for examination using
the standard commands available.
It is quite possible with long running rclone sessions for copies of
passwords to be innocently captured in log files or terminal scroll
buffers, etc.
Using the script method of supplying the password enhances the security
of the config password considerably.
.PP
If you are running rclone inside a script, unless you are using the
\f[C]--password-command\f[R] method, you might want to disable password
prompts.
To do that, pass the parameter \f[C]--ask-password=false\f[R] to rclone.
This will make rclone fail instead of asking for a password if
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] doesn\[aq]t contain a valid password, and
\f[C]--password-command\f[R] has not been supplied.
.PP
Whenever running commands that may be affected by options in a
configuration file, rclone will look for an existing file according to
the rules described above, and load any it finds.
If an encrypted file is found, this includes decrypting it, with the
possible consequence of a password prompt.
When executing a command line that you know are not actually using
anything from such a configuration file, you can avoid it being loaded
by overriding the location, e.g.
with one of the documented special values for memory-only configuration.
Since only backend options can be stored in configuration files, this is
normally unnecessary for commands that do not operate on backends, e.g.
\f[C]genautocomplete\f[R].
However, it will be relevant for commands that do operate on backends in
general, but are used without referencing a stored remote, e.g.
listing local filesystem paths, or connection strings:
\f[C]rclone --config=\[dq]\[dq] ls .\f[R]
.SS Developer options
.PP
These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.
There are also some more remote specific options which aren\[aq]t
documented here which are used for testing.
These start with remote name e.g.
\f[C]--drive-test-option\f[R] - see the docs for the remote in question.
.SS --cpuprofile=FILE
.PP
Write CPU profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go tool pprof\f[R].
.SS --dump flag,flag,flag
.PP
The \f[C]--dump\f[R] flag takes a comma separated list of flags to dump
info about.
.PP
Note that some headers including \f[C]Accept-Encoding\f[R] as shown may
not be correct in the request and the response may not show
\f[C]Content-Encoding\f[R] if the go standard libraries auto gzip
encoding was in effect.
In this case the body of the request will be gunzipped before showing
it.
.PP
The available flags are:
.SS --dump headers
.PP
Dump HTTP headers with \f[C]Authorization:\f[R] lines removed.
May still contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.PP
Use \f[C]--dump auth\f[R] if you do want the \f[C]Authorization:\f[R]
headers.
.SS --dump bodies
.PP
Dump HTTP headers and bodies - may contain sensitive info.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.PP
Note that the bodies are buffered in memory so don\[aq]t use this for
enormous files.
.SS --dump requests
.PP
Like \f[C]--dump bodies\f[R] but dumps the request bodies and the
response headers.
Useful for debugging download problems.
.SS --dump responses
.PP
Like \f[C]--dump bodies\f[R] but dumps the response bodies and the
request headers.
Useful for debugging upload problems.
.SS --dump auth
.PP
Dump HTTP headers - will contain sensitive info such as
\f[C]Authorization:\f[R] headers - use \f[C]--dump headers\f[R] to dump
without \f[C]Authorization:\f[R] headers.
Can be very verbose.
Useful for debugging only.
.SS --dump filters
.PP
Dump the filters to the output.
Useful to see exactly what include and exclude options are filtering on.
.SS --dump goroutines
.PP
This dumps a list of the running go-routines at the end of the command
to standard output.
.SS --dump openfiles
.PP
This dumps a list of the open files at the end of the command.
It uses the \f[C]lsof\f[R] command to do that so you\[aq]ll need that
installed to use it.
.SS --memprofile=FILE
.PP
Write memory profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go tool pprof\f[R].

.SS Logging
.PP
rclone has 4 levels of logging, \f[C]ERROR\f[R], \f[C]NOTICE\f[R],
\f[C]INFO\f[R] and \f[C]DEBUG\f[R].
.PP
By default, rclone logs to standard error.
This means you can redirect standard error and still see the normal
output of rclone commands (e.g.
\f[C]rclone ls\f[R]).
.PP
By default, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[R] and \f[C]Notice\f[R]
level messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]-q\f[R] flag, rclone will only produce
\f[C]Error\f[R] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]-v\f[R] flag, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[R],
\f[C]Notice\f[R] and \f[C]Info\f[R] messages.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]-vv\f[R] flag, rclone will produce \f[C]Error\f[R],
\f[C]Notice\f[R], \f[C]Info\f[R] and \f[C]Debug\f[R] messages.
.PP
You can also control the log levels with the \f[C]--log-level\f[R] flag.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]--log-file=FILE\f[R] option, rclone will redirect
\f[C]Error\f[R], \f[C]Info\f[R] and \f[C]Debug\f[R] messages along with
standard error to FILE.
.PP
If you use the \f[C]--syslog\f[R] flag then rclone will log to syslog
and the \f[C]--syslog-facility\f[R] control which facility it uses.
.PP
Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, e.g.
INFO which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of
information.
.SS Exit Code
.PP
If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with
a non-zero exit code.
This allows scripts to detect when rclone operations have failed.
.PP
During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is
detected in the configuration.
There will always be a log message immediately before exiting.
.PP
When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
only exit with a non-zero exit code if (after retries) there were still
failed transfers.
For every error counted there will be a high priority log message
(visible with \f[C]-q\f[R]) showing the message and which file caused
the problem.
A high priority message is also shown when starting a retry so the user
can see that any previous error messages may not be valid after the
retry.
If rclone has done a retry it will log a high priority message if the
retry was successful.
.SS List of exit codes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]0\f[R] - success
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]1\f[R] - Syntax or usage error

.SS Environment Variables
.PP
Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables.
These can be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.
.SS Options
.PP
Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment variable.
.PP
To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long
option name, strip the leading \f[C]--\f[R], change \f[C]-\f[R] to
\f[C]_\f[R], make upper case and prepend \f[C]RCLONE_\f[R].
.PP
For example, to always set \f[C]--stats 5s\f[R], set the environment
variable \f[C]RCLONE_STATS=5s\f[R].
If you set stats on the command line this will override the environment
variable setting.
.PP
Or to always use the trash in drive \f[C]--drive-use-trash\f[R], set
\f[C]RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true\f[R].
.PP
The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables so
they take exactly the same form.
.PP
The options set by environment variables can be seen with the
\f[C]-vv\f[R] flag, e.g.
\f[C]rclone version -vv\f[R].
.SS Config file
.PP
You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual
remote basis.
The names of the config items are documented in the page for each
backend.
.PP
To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_\f[R] + name of remote + \f[C]_\f[R] + name of config
file option and make it all uppercase.
.PP
For example, to configure an S3 remote named \f[C]mys3:\f[R] without a
config file (using unix ways of setting environment variables):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone listremotes | grep mys3
mys3:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables you
must create the \f[C]..._TYPE\f[R] variable as above.
.PP
Note that the name of a remote created using environment variable is
case insensitive, in contrast to regular remotes stored in config file
as documented above.
You must write the name in uppercase in the environment variable, but as
seen from example above it will be listed and can be accessed in
lowercase, while you can also refer to the same remote in uppercase:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone lsd MYS3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that you can only set the options of the immediate backend, so
RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3CRYPT_ACCESS_KEY_ID has no effect, if myS3Crypt is a
crypt remote based on an S3 remote.
However RCLONE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID will set the access key of all remotes
using S3, including myS3Crypt.
.PP
Note also that now rclone has connection strings, it is probably easier
to use those instead which makes the above example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd :s3,access_key_id=XXX,secret_access_key=XXX:
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Precedence
.PP
The various different methods of backend configuration are read in this
order and the first one with a value is used.
.IP \[bu] 2
Parameters in connection strings, e.g.
\f[C]myRemote,skip_links:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g.
\f[C]--skip-links\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2

\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_SKIP_LINKS\f[R] (see above).
.IP \[bu] 2
Backend-specific environment vars, e.g.
\f[C]RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Backend generic environment vars, e.g.
\f[C]RCLONE_SKIP_LINKS\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2

\f[C]false\f[R] - these can\[aq]t be changed.
.PP
So if both \f[C]--skip-links\f[R] is supplied on the command line and an
environment variable \f[C]RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS\f[R] is set, the
command line flag will take preference.
.PP
The backend configurations set by environment variables can be seen with
the \f[C]-vv\f[R] flag, e.g.
\f[C]rclone about myRemote: -vv\f[R].
.PP
For non backend configuration the order is as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g.
\f[C]--stats 5s\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Environment vars, e.g.
\f[C]RCLONE_STATS=5s\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Default values, e.g.
\f[C]1m\f[R] - these can\[aq]t be changed.
.SS Other environment variables
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] set to contain your config file password
(see Configuration Encryption section)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[R], \f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[R] and \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[R] (or
the lowercase versions thereof).
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[R] takes precedence over \f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[R] for

assumed.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]USER\f[R] and \f[C]LOGNAME\f[R] values are used as fallbacks for
current username.
The primary method for looking up username is OS-specific: Windows API
on Windows, real user ID in /etc/passwd on Unix systems.
In the documentation the current username is simply referred to as
\f[C]$USER\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR\f[R] - rclone \f[B]sets\f[R] this variable for
use in config files and sub processes to point to the directory holding
the config file.
.PP
The options set by environment variables can be seen with the
\f[C]-vv\f[R] and \f[C]--log-level=DEBUG\f[R] flags, e.g.
\f[C]rclone version -vv\f[R].
.SH Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine
.PP
Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an Internet
connected web browser.
.PP
If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (e.g.
a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then you will need to use an
alternative means of configuration.
There are two ways of doing it, described below.
.SS Configuring using rclone authorize
.PP
On the headless box run \f[C]rclone\f[R] config but answer \f[C]N\f[R]
to the \f[C]Use auto config?\f[R] question.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\&...
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n> n
For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has
a web browser available.

For more help and alternate methods see: https://rclone.org/remote_setup/

Execute the following on the machine with the web browser (same rclone
version recommended):

    rclone authorize \[dq]amazon cloud drive\[dq]

Then paste the result below:
result>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then on your main desktop machine
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone authorize \[dq]amazon cloud drive\[dq]
If your browser doesn\[aq]t open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Paste the following into your remote machine --->
SECRET_TOKEN
<---End paste
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then back to the headless box, paste in the code
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
result> SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
[acd12]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Configuring by copying the config file
.PP
Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file.
This can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.
.PP
So first configure rclone on your desktop machine with
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
to set up the config file.
.PP
Find the config file by running \f[C]rclone config file\f[R], for
example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone config file
Configuration file is stored at:
/home/user/.rclone.conf
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp, etc.) and
place it in the correct place (use \f[C]rclone config file\f[R] on the
remote box to find out where).
.SH Filtering, includes and excludes
.PP
Filter flags determine which files rclone \f[C]sync\f[R],
\f[C]move\f[R], \f[C]ls\f[R], \f[C]lsl\f[R], \f[C]md5sum\f[R],
\f[C]sha1sum\f[R], \f[C]size\f[R], \f[C]delete\f[R], \f[C]check\f[R] and
similar commands apply to.
.PP
They are specified in terms of path/file name patterns; path/file lists;
file age and size, or presence of a file in a directory.
Bucket based remotes without the concept of directory apply filters to
object key, age and size in an analogous way.
.PP
Rclone \f[C]purge\f[R] does not obey filters.
.PP
To test filters without risk of damage to data, apply them to
\f[C]rclone ls\f[R], or with the \f[C]--dry-run\f[R] and \f[C]-vv\f[R]
flags.
.PP
Rclone filter patterns can only be used in filter command line options,
not in the specification of a remote.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone copy \[dq]remote:dir*.jpg\[dq] /path/to/dir\f[R] does not
have a filter effect.
\f[C]rclone copy remote:dir /path/to/dir --include \[dq]*.jpg\[dq]\f[R]
does.
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R] Avoid mixing any two of \f[C]--include...\f[R],
\f[C]--exclude...\f[R] or \f[C]--filter...\f[R] flags in an rclone
command.
The results may not be what you expect.
Instead use a \f[C]--filter...\f[R] flag.
.SS Patterns for matching path/file names
.SS Pattern syntax
.PP
Here is a formal definition of the pattern syntax, examples are below.
.PP
Rclone matching rules follow a glob style:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*         matches any sequence of non-separator (/) characters
**        matches any sequence of characters including / separators
?         matches any single non-separator (/) character
[ [ ! ] { character-range } ]
          character class (must be non-empty)
{ pattern-list }
          pattern alternatives
{{ regexp }}
          regular expression to match
c         matches character c (c != *, **, ?, \[rs], [, {, })
\[rs]c        matches reserved character c (c = *, **, ?, \[rs], [, {, }) or character class
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
character-range:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
c         matches character c (c != \[rs], -, ])
\[rs]c        matches reserved character c (c = \[rs], -, ])
lo - hi   matches character c for lo <= c <= hi
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
pattern-list:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pattern { , pattern }
          comma-separated (without spaces) patterns
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
character classes (see Go regular expression
reference (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/)) include:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Named character classes (e.g. [\[rs]d], [\[ha]\[rs]d], [\[rs]D], [\[ha]\[rs]D])
Perl character classes (e.g. \[rs]s, \[rs]S, \[rs]w, \[rs]W)
ASCII character classes (e.g. [[:alnum:]], [[:alpha:]], [[:punct:]], [[:xdigit:]])
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
regexp for advanced users to insert a regular expression - see below for
more info:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Any re2 regular expression not containing \[ga]}}\[ga]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If the filter pattern starts with a \f[C]/\f[R] then it only matches at
the top level of the directory tree, \f[B]relative to the root of the
remote\f[R] (not necessarily the root of the drive).
If it does not start with \f[C]/\f[R] then it is matched starting at the
\f[B]end of the path/file name\f[R] but it only matches a complete path
element - it must match from a \f[C]/\f[R] separator or the beginning of
the path/file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
file.jpg   - matches \[dq]file.jpg\[dq]
           - matches \[dq]directory/file.jpg\[dq]
           - doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]afile.jpg\[dq]
           - doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]directory/afile.jpg\[dq]
/file.jpg  - matches \[dq]file.jpg\[dq] in the root directory of the remote
           - doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]afile.jpg\[dq]
           - doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]directory/file.jpg\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The top level of the remote may not be the top level of the drive.
.PP

.PP
To copy the contents of folder \f[C]data\f[R] into folder \f[C]bkp\f[R]

.PP
\f[C]rclone copy F:\[rs]data\[rs] F:\[rs]bkp\[rs] --exclude=/excl/**\f[R]

.fi
.SS Using regular expressions in filter patterns
.PP
The syntax of filter patterns is glob style matching (like
\f[C]bash\f[R] uses) to make things easy for users.
However this does not provide absolute control over the matching, so for
advanced users rclone also provides a regular expression syntax.
.PP
The regular expressions used are as defined in the Go regular expression
reference (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/).
Regular expressions should be enclosed in \f[C]{{\f[R] \f[C]}}\f[R].
They will match only the last path segment if the glob doesn\[aq]t start
with \f[C]/\f[R] or the whole path name if it does.
.PP
Here is how the \f[C]{{regexp}}\f[R] is transformed into an full regular
expression to match the entire path:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{{regexp}}  becomes (\[ha]|/)(regexp)$
/{{regexp}} becomes \[ha](regexp)$
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Regexp syntax can be mixed with glob syntax, for example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*.{{jpe?g}} to match file.jpg, file.jpeg but not file.png
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can also use regexp flags - to set case insensitive, for example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*.{{(?i)jpg}} to match file.jpg, file.JPG but not file.png
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Be careful with wildcards in regular expressions - you don\[aq]t want
them to match path separators normally.
To match any file name starting with \f[C]start\f[R] and ending with
\f[C]end\f[R] write
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{{start[\[ha]/]*end\[rs].jpg}}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Not
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{{start.*end\[rs].jpg}}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Which will match a directory called \f[C]start\f[R] with a file called
\f[C]end.jpg\f[R] in it as the \f[C].*\f[R] will match \f[C]/\f[R]
characters.
.PP
Note that you can use \f[C]-vv --dump filters\f[R] to show the filter
patterns in regexp format - rclone implements the glob patters by
transforming them into regular expressions.

.TE
.SS How filter rules are applied to files
.PP
Rclone path/file name filters are made up of one or more of the
following flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--include\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--include-from\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--exclude\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--exclude-from\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--filter\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--filter-from\f[R]
.PP
There can be more than one instance of individual flags.
.PP
Rclone internally uses a combined list of all the include and exclude
rules.
The order in which rules are processed can influence the result of the
filter.
.PP
All flags of the same type are processed together in the order above,
regardless of what order the different types of flags are included on
the command line.
.PP
Multiple instances of the same flag are processed from left to right
according to their position in the command line.
.PP
To mix up the order of processing includes and excludes use
\f[C]--filter...\f[R] flags.
.PP
Within \f[C]--include-from\f[R], \f[C]--exclude-from\f[R] and
\f[C]--filter-from\f[R] flags rules are processed from top to bottom of
the referenced file.
.PP
If there is an \f[C]--include\f[R] or \f[C]--include-from\f[R] flag
specified, rclone implies a \f[C]- **\f[R] rule which it adds to the
bottom of the internal rule list.
Specifying a \f[C]+\f[R] rule with a \f[C]--filter...\f[R] flag does not
imply that rule.
.PP
Each path/file name passed through rclone is matched against the
combined filter list.
At first match to a rule the path/file name is included or excluded and
no further filter rules are processed for that path/file.
.PP
If rclone does not find a match, after testing against all rules
(including the implied rule if appropriate), the path/file name is
included.
.PP
Any path/file included at that stage is processed by the rclone command.
.PP
\f[C]--files-from\f[R] and \f[C]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags over-ride
and cannot be combined with other filter options.
.PP
To see the internal combined rule list, in regular expression form, for
a command add the \f[C]--dump filters\f[R] flag.
Running an rclone command with \f[C]--dump filters\f[R] and
\f[C]-vv\f[R] flags lists the internal filter elements and shows how
they are applied to each source path/file.
There is not currently a means provided to pass regular expression
filter options into rclone directly though character class filter rules
contain character classes.
Go regular expression reference (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/)
.SS How filter rules are applied to directories
.PP
Rclone commands are applied to path/file names not directories.
The entire contents of a directory can be matched to a filter by the
pattern \f[C]directory/*\f[R] or recursively by \f[C]directory/**\f[R].
.PP
Directory filter rules are defined with a closing \f[C]/\f[R] separator.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]/directory/subdirectory/\f[R] is an rclone directory filter rule.
.PP
Rclone commands can use directory filter rules to determine whether they
recurse into subdirectories.
This potentially optimises access to a remote by avoiding listing
unnecessary directories.
Whether optimisation is desirable depends on the specific filter rules
and source remote content.
.PP
Directory recursion optimisation occurs if either:
.IP \[bu] 2
A source remote does not support the rclone \f[C]ListR\f[R] primitive.
local, sftp, Microsoft OneDrive and WebDav do not support
\f[C]ListR\f[R].
Google Drive and most bucket type storage do.
Full list (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
.IP \[bu] 2
On other remotes (those that support \f[C]ListR\f[R]), if the rclone
command is not naturally recursive, and provided it is not run with the
\f[C]--fast-list\f[R] flag.
\f[C]ls\f[R], \f[C]lsf -R\f[R] and \f[C]size\f[R] are naturally
recursive but \f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R] and \f[C]move\f[R] are not.
.IP \[bu] 2
Whenever the \f[C]--disable ListR\f[R] flag is applied to an rclone
command.
.PP
Rclone commands imply directory filter rules from path/file filter
rules.
To view the directory filter rules rclone has implied for a command
specify the \f[C]--dump filters\f[R] flag.
.PP
E.g.
for an include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/*.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone implies the directory include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Directory filter rules specified in an rclone command can limit the
scope of an rclone command but path/file filters still have to be
specified.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --include /directory/\f[R] will not match any
files.
Because it is an \f[C]--include\f[R] option the \f[C]--exclude **\f[R]
rule is implied, and the \f[C]/directory/\f[R] pattern serves only to
optimise access to the remote by ignoring everything outside of that
directory.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-list.txt\f[R] with a file
\f[C]filter-list.txt\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- /dir1/
- /dir2/
+ *.pdf
- **
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
All files in directories \f[C]dir1\f[R] or \f[C]dir2\f[R] or their
subdirectories are completely excluded from the listing.
Only files of suffix \f[C]pdf\f[R] in the root of \f[C]remote:\f[R] or
its subdirectories are listed.
The \f[C]- **\f[R] rule prevents listing of any path/files not
previously matched by the rules above.
.PP
Option \f[C]exclude-if-present\f[R] creates a directory exclude rule
based on the presence of a file in a directory and takes precedence over
other rclone directory filter rules.
.PP
When using pattern list syntax, if a pattern item contains either
\f[C]/\f[R] or \f[C]**\f[R], then rclone will not able to imply a
directory filter rule from this pattern list.
.PP
E.g.
for an include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{dir1/**,dir2/**}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rclone will match files below directories \f[C]dir1\f[R] or
\f[C]dir2\f[R] only, but will not be able to use this filter to exclude
a directory \f[C]dir3\f[R] from being traversed.
.PP
Directory recursion optimisation may affect performance, but normally
not the result.
One exception to this is sync operations with option
\f[C]--create-empty-src-dirs\f[R], where any traversed empty directories
will be created.
With the pattern list example \f[C]{dir1/**,dir2/**}\f[R] above, this
would create an empty directory \f[C]dir3\f[R] on destination (when it
exists on source).
Changing the filter to \f[C]{dir1,dir2}/**\f[R], or splitting it into
two include rules \f[C]--include dir1/** --include dir2/**\f[R], will
match the same files while also filtering directories, with the result
that an empty directory \f[C]dir3\f[R] will no longer be created.
.SS \f[C]--exclude\f[R] - Exclude files matching pattern
.PP
Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on a single
exclude rule.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
\f[C]--exclude\f[R] should not be used with \f[C]--include\f[R],
\f[C]--include-from\f[R], \f[C]--filter\f[R] or \f[C]--filter-from\f[R]
flags.
.PP
\f[C]--exclude\f[R] has no effect when combined with
\f[C]--files-from\f[R] or \f[C]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --exclude *.bak\f[R] excludes all .bak files from
listing.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone size remote: \[dq]--exclude /dir/**\[dq]\f[R] returns the
total size of all files on \f[C]remote:\f[R] excluding those in root
directory \f[C]dir\f[R] and sub directories.
.PP
E.g.
on Microsoft Windows
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --exclude \[dq]*\[rs][{JP,KR,HK}\[rs]]*\[dq]\f[R]
lists the files in \f[C]remote:\f[R] with \f[C][JP]\f[R] or
\f[C][KR]\f[R] or \f[C][HK]\f[R] in their name.
Quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the \f[C]\[rs]\f[R]
characters.\f[C]\[rs]\f[R] characters escape the \f[C][\f[R] and
\f[C]]\f[R] so an rclone filter treats them literally rather than as a
character-range.
The \f[C]{\f[R] and \f[C]}\f[R] define an rclone pattern list.
For other operating systems single quotes are required ie
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --exclude \[aq]*\[rs][{JP,KR,HK}\[rs]]*\[aq]\f[R]
.SS \f[C]--exclude-from\f[R] - Read exclude patterns from file
.PP
Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on rules in a
named file.
The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.
.PP
For an example \f[C]exclude-file.txt\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# a sample exclude rule file
*.bak
file2.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --exclude-from exclude-file.txt\f[R] lists the
files on \f[C]remote:\f[R] except those named \f[C]file2.jpg\f[R] or
with a suffix \f[C].bak\f[R].
That is equivalent to
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --exclude file2.jpg --exclude \[dq]*.bak\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
The \f[C]--exclude-from\f[R] flag is useful where multiple exclude
filter rules are applied to an rclone command.
.PP
\f[C]--exclude-from\f[R] should not be used with \f[C]--include\f[R],
\f[C]--include-from\f[R], \f[C]--filter\f[R] or \f[C]--filter-from\f[R]
flags.
.PP
\f[C]--exclude-from\f[R] has no effect when combined with
\f[C]--files-from\f[R] or \f[C]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags.
.PP
\f[C]--exclude-from\f[R] followed by \f[C]-\f[R] reads filter rules from
standard input.
.SS \f[C]--include\f[R] - Include files matching pattern
.PP
Adds a single include rule based on path/file names to an rclone
command.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
\f[C]--include\f[R] has no effect when combined with
\f[C]--files-from\f[R] or \f[C]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags.
.PP
\f[C]--include\f[R] implies \f[C]--exclude **\f[R] at the end of an
rclone internal filter list.
Therefore if you mix \f[C]--include\f[R] and \f[C]--include-from\f[R]
flags with \f[C]--exclude\f[R], \f[C]--exclude-from\f[R],
\f[C]--filter\f[R] or \f[C]--filter-from\f[R], you must use include
rules for all the files you want in the include statement.
For more flexibility use the \f[C]--filter-from\f[R] flag.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --include \[dq]*.{png,jpg}\[dq]\f[R] lists the
files on \f[C]remote:\f[R] with suffix \f[C].png\f[R] and
\f[C].jpg\f[R].
All other files are excluded.
.PP
E.g.
multiple rclone copy commands can be combined with \f[C]--include\f[R]
and a pattern-list.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /vol1/A remote:A
rclone copy /vol1/B remote:B
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
is equivalent to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /vol1 remote: --include \[dq]{A,B}/**\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote:/wheat --include \[dq]??[\[ha][:punct:]]*\[dq]\f[R]
lists the files \f[C]remote:\f[R] directory \f[C]wheat\f[R] (and
subdirectories) whose third character is not punctuation.
This example uses an ASCII character
class (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/).
.SS \f[C]--include-from\f[R] - Read include patterns from file
.PP
Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a named
file.
The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.
.PP
For an example \f[C]include-file.txt\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# a sample include rule file
*.jpg
file2.avi
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --include-from include-file.txt\f[R] lists the
files on \f[C]remote:\f[R] with name \f[C]file2.avi\f[R] or suffix
\f[C].jpg\f[R].
That is equivalent to
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --include file2.avi --include \[dq]*.jpg\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
The \f[C]--include-from\f[R] flag is useful where multiple include
filter rules are applied to an rclone command.
.PP
\f[C]--include-from\f[R] implies \f[C]--exclude **\f[R] at the end of an

.PP
\f[C]--exclude-from\f[R] followed by \f[C]-\f[R] reads filter rules from
standard input.
.SS \f[C]--filter\f[R] - Add a file-filtering rule
.PP
Specifies path/file names to an rclone command, based on a single
include or exclude rule, in \f[C]+\f[R] or \f[C]-\f[R] format.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
\f[C]--filter +\f[R] differs from \f[C]--include\f[R].
In the case of \f[C]--include\f[R] rclone implies an
\f[C]--exclude *\f[R] rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal
rule list.
\f[C]--filter...+\f[R] does not imply that rule.
.PP
\f[C]--filter\f[R] has no effect when combined with
\f[C]--files-from\f[R] or \f[C]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags.
.PP
\f[C]--filter\f[R] should not be used with \f[C]--include\f[R],
\f[C]--include-from\f[R], \f[C]--exclude\f[R] or
\f[C]--exclude-from\f[R] flags.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --filter \[dq]- *.bak\[dq]\f[R] excludes all
\f[C].bak\f[R] files from a list of \f[C]remote:\f[R].
.SS \f[C]--filter-from\f[R] - Read filtering patterns from a file
.PP
Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a named
file.
The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.
Include rules start with \f[C]+\f[R] and exclude rules with \f[C]-\f[R].
\f[C]!\f[R] clears existing rules.
Rules are processed in the order they are defined.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
Arrange the order of filter rules with the most restrictive first and
work down.
.PP
E.g.
for \f[C]filter-file.txt\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# a sample filter rule file
- secret*.jpg
+ *.jpg
+ *.png
+ file2.avi
- /dir/Trash/**
+ /dir/**
# exclude everything else
- *
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-file.txt\f[R] lists the
path/files on \f[C]remote:\f[R] including all \f[C]jpg\f[R] and
\f[C]png\f[R] files, excluding any matching \f[C]secret*.jpg\f[R] and
including \f[C]file2.avi\f[R].
It also includes everything in the directory \f[C]dir\f[R] at the root
of \f[C]remote\f[R], except \f[C]remote:dir/Trash\f[R] which it
excludes.
Everything else is excluded.
.PP
E.g.
for an alternative \f[C]filter-file.txt\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- secret*.jpg
+ *.jpg
+ *.png
+ file2.avi
- *
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Files \f[C]file1.jpg\f[R], \f[C]file3.png\f[R] and \f[C]file2.avi\f[R]
are listed whilst \f[C]secret17.jpg\f[R] and files without the suffix
\&.jpg\f[C]or\f[R].png\[ga] are excluded.
.PP
E.g.
for an alternative \f[C]filter-file.txt\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
+ *.jpg
+ *.gif
!
+ 42.doc
- *
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Only file 42.doc is listed.
Prior rules are cleared by the \f[C]!\f[R].
.SS \f[C]--files-from\f[R] - Read list of source-file names
.PP
Adds path/files to an rclone command from a list in a named file.
Rclone processes the path/file names in the order of the list, and no
others.
.PP
Other filter flags (\f[C]--include\f[R], \f[C]--include-from\f[R],
\f[C]--exclude\f[R], \f[C]--exclude-from\f[R], \f[C]--filter\f[R] and
\f[C]--filter-from\f[R]) are ignored when \f[C]--files-from\f[R] is
used.
.PP
\f[C]--files-from\f[R] expects a list of files as its input.
Leading or trailing whitespace is stripped from the input lines.
Lines starting with \f[C]#\f[R] or \f[C];\f[R] are ignored.
.PP
Rclone commands with a \f[C]--files-from\f[R] flag traverse the remote,
treating the names in \f[C]--files-from\f[R] as a set of filters.
.PP
If the \f[C]--no-traverse\f[R] and \f[C]--files-from\f[R] flags are used
together an rclone command does not traverse the remote.
Instead it addresses each path/file named in the file individually.
For each path/file name, that requires typically 1 API call.
This can be efficient for a short \f[C]--files-from\f[R] list and a
remote containing many files.
.PP
Rclone commands do not error if any names in the \f[C]--files-from\f[R]
file are missing from the source remote.
.PP
The \f[C]--files-from\f[R] flag can be repeated in a single rclone
command to read path/file names from more than one file.
The files are read from left to right along the command line.
.PP
Paths within the \f[C]--files-from\f[R] file are interpreted as starting
with the root specified in the rclone command.
Leading \f[C]/\f[R] separators are ignored.
See --files-from-raw if you need the input to be processed in a raw
manner.
.PP
E.g.
for a file \f[C]files-from.txt\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# comment
file1.jpg
subdir/file2.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home/me/pics remote:pics\f[R]
copies the following, if they exist, and only those files.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/me/pics/file1.jpg        \[->] remote:pics/file1.jpg
/home/me/pics/subdir/file2.jpg \[->] remote:pics/subdir/file2.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
E.g.
to copy the following files referenced by their absolute paths:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/42
/home/user1/dir/ford
/home/user2/prefect
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
First find a common subdirectory - in this case \f[C]/home\f[R] and put
the remaining files in \f[C]files-from.txt\f[R] with or without leading
\f[C]/\f[R], e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
user1/42
user1/dir/ford
user2/prefect
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then copy these to a remote:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The three files are transferred as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/42       \[->] remote:backup/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/ford \[->] remote:backup/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/prefect  \[->] remote:backup/user2/stuff
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Alternatively if \f[C]/\f[R] is chosen as root \f[C]files-from.txt\f[R]
will be:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/42
/home/user1/dir/ford
/home/user2/prefect
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The copy command will be:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt / remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then there will be an extra \f[C]home\f[R] directory on the remote:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/42       \[->] remote:backup/home/user1/42
/home/user1/dir/ford \[->] remote:backup/home/user1/dir/ford
/home/user2/prefect  \[->] remote:backup/home/user2/prefect
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \f[C]--files-from-raw\f[R] - Read list of source-file names without any processing
.PP
This flag is the same as \f[C]--files-from\f[R] except that input is
read in a raw manner.
Lines with leading / trailing whitespace, and lines starting with
\f[C];\f[R] or \f[C]#\f[R] are read without any processing.
rclone lsf (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/) has a compatible
format that can be used to export file lists from remotes for input to
\f[C]--files-from-raw\f[R].
.SS \f[C]--ignore-case\f[R] - make searches case insensitive
.PP
By default, rclone filter patterns are case sensitive.
The \f[C]--ignore-case\f[R] flag makes all of the filters patterns on
the command line case insensitive.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]--include \[dq]zaphod.txt\[dq]\f[R] does not match a file
\f[C]Zaphod.txt\f[R].
With \f[C]--ignore-case\f[R] a match is made.
.SS Quoting shell metacharacters
.PP
Rclone commands with filter patterns containing shell metacharacters may
not as work as expected in your shell and may require quoting.
.PP
E.g.
linux, OSX (\f[C]*\f[R] metacharacter)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--include \[rs]*.jpg\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--include \[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--include=\[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[R]
.PP
Microsoft Windows expansion is done by the command, not shell, so
\f[C]--include *.jpg\f[R] does not require quoting.
.PP
If the rclone error
\f[C]Command .... needs .... arguments maximum: you provided .... non flag arguments:\f[R]
is encountered, the cause is commonly spaces within the name of a remote
or flag value.
The fix then is to quote values containing spaces.
.SS Other filters
.SS \f[C]--min-size\f[R] - Don\[aq]t transfer any file smaller than this
.PP
Controls the minimum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are \f[C]KiB\f[R] but abbreviations \f[C]K\f[R],
\f[C]M\f[R], \f[C]G\f[R], \f[C]T\f[R] or \f[C]P\f[R] are valid.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --min-size 50k\f[R] lists files on
\f[C]remote:\f[R] of 50 KiB size or larger.
.SS \f[C]--max-size\f[R] - Don\[aq]t transfer any file larger than this
.PP
Controls the maximum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are \f[C]KiB\f[R] but abbreviations \f[C]K\f[R],
\f[C]M\f[R], \f[C]G\f[R], \f[C]T\f[R] or \f[C]P\f[R] are valid.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --max-size 1G\f[R] lists files on
\f[C]remote:\f[R] of 1 GiB size or smaller.
.SS \f[C]--max-age\f[R] - Don\[aq]t transfer any file older than this
.PP
Controls the maximum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are seconds or the following abbreviations are valid:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ms\f[R] - Milliseconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]s\f[R] - Seconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]m\f[R] - Minutes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]h\f[R] - Hours
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]d\f[R] - Days
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]w\f[R] - Weeks
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]M\f[R] - Months
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]y\f[R] - Years
.PP
\f[C]--max-age\f[R] can also be specified as an absolute time in the
following formats:
.IP \[bu] 2
RFC3339 - e.g.
\f[C]2006-01-02T15:04:05Z\f[R] or \f[C]2006-01-02T15:04:05+07:00\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - \f[C]2006-01-02T15:04:05\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - \f[C]2006-01-02 15:04:05\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
ISO8601 Date - \f[C]2006-01-02\f[R] (YYYY-MM-DD)
.PP
\f[C]--max-age\f[R] applies only to files and not to directories.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --max-age 2d\f[R] lists files on
\f[C]remote:\f[R] of 2 days old or less.
.SS \f[C]--min-age\f[R] - Don\[aq]t transfer any file younger than this
.PP
Controls the minimum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.
(see \f[C]--max-age\f[R] for valid formats)
.PP
\f[C]--min-age\f[R] applies only to files and not to directories.
.PP
E.g.
\f[C]rclone ls remote: --min-age 2d\f[R] lists files on
\f[C]remote:\f[R] of 2 days old or more.
.SS Other flags
.SS \f[C]--delete-excluded\f[R] - Delete files on dest excluded from sync
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R] this flag is dangerous to your data - use with
\f[C]--dry-run\f[R] and \f[C]-v\f[R] first.
.PP
In conjunction with \f[C]rclone sync\f[R], \f[C]--delete-excluded\f[R]
deletes any files on the destination which are excluded from the
command.
.PP
E.g.
the scope of \f[C]rclone sync -i A: B:\f[R] can be restricted:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone --min-size 50k --delete-excluded sync A: B:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
All files on \f[C]B:\f[R] which are less than 50 KiB are deleted because
they are excluded from the rclone sync command.
.SS \f[C]--dump filters\f[R] - dump the filters to the output
.PP
Dumps the defined filters to standard output in regular expression
format.
.PP
Useful for debugging.
.SS Exclude directory based on a file
.PP
The \f[C]--exclude-if-present\f[R] flag controls whether a directory is
within the scope of an rclone command based on the presence of a named
file within it.
.PP
This flag has a priority over other filter flags.
.PP
E.g.
for the following directory structure:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dir1/file1
dir1/dir2/file2
dir1/dir2/dir3/file3
dir1/dir2/dir3/.ignore
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The command \f[C]rclone ls --exclude-if-present .ignore dir1\f[R] does
not list \f[C]dir3\f[R], \f[C]file3\f[R] or \f[C].ignore\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]--exclude-if-present\f[R] can only be used once in an rclone
command.
.SS Common pitfalls
.PP
The most frequent filter support issues on the rclone
forum (https://forum.rclone.org/) are:
.IP \[bu] 2
Not using paths relative to the root of the remote
.IP \[bu] 2
Not using \f[C]/\f[R] to match from the root of a remote
.IP \[bu] 2
Not using \f[C]**\f[R] to match the contents of a directory
.SH GUI (Experimental)
.PP
Rclone can serve a web based GUI (graphical user interface).
This is somewhat experimental at the moment so things may be subject to
change.
.PP
Run this command in a terminal and rclone will download and then display
the GUI in a web browser.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rcd --rc-web-gui
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will produce logs like this and rclone needs to continue to run to

Add \f[C]--rc-web-gui-no-open-browser\f[R] to disable this feature.
.SS Using the GUI
.PP
Once the GUI opens, you will be looking at the dashboard which has an
overall overview.
.PP
On the left hand side you will see a series of view buttons you can
click on:
.IP \[bu] 2
Dashboard - main overview
.IP \[bu] 2
Configs - examine and create new configurations
.IP \[bu] 2
Explorer - view, download and upload files to the cloud storage systems
.IP \[bu] 2
Backend - view or alter the backend config
.IP \[bu] 2
Log out

(More docs and walkthrough video to come!)
.SS How it works
.PP
When you run the \f[C]rclone rcd --rc-web-gui\f[R] this is what happens
.IP \[bu] 2
Rclone starts but only runs the remote control API (\[dq]rc\[dq]).
.IP \[bu] 2
The API is bound to localhost with an auto-generated username and
password.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the API bundle is missing then rclone will download it.
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone will start serving the files from the API bundle over the same
port as the API
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone will open the browser with a \f[C]login_token\f[R] so it can log
straight in.
.SS Advanced use
.PP
The \f[C]rclone rcd\f[R] may use any of the flags documented on the rc
page (https://rclone.org/rc/#supported-parameters).
.PP
The flag \f[C]--rc-web-gui\f[R] is shorthand for
.IP \[bu] 2
Download the web GUI if necessary
.IP \[bu] 2
Check we are using some authentication
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-user gui\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-pass <random password>\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-serve\f[R]
.PP
These flags can be overridden as desired.
.PP
See also the rclone rcd
documentation (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).
.SS Example: Running a public GUI
.PP
For example the GUI could be served on a public port over SSL using an
htpasswd file using the following flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-web-gui\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-addr :443\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-cert /path/to/ssl.crt\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-key /path/to/ssl.key\f[R]
.SS Example: Running a GUI behind a proxy
.PP
If you want to run the GUI behind a proxy at \f[C]/rclone\f[R] you could
use these flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-web-gui\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-baseurl rclone\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R]
.PP
Or instead of htpasswd if you just want a single user and password:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-user me\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--rc-pass mypassword\f[R]
.SS Project
.PP
The GUI is being developed in the: rclone/rclone-webui-react
repository (https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react).
.PP
Bug reports and contributions are very welcome :-)
.PP
If you have questions then please ask them on the rclone
forum (https://forum.rclone.org/).
.SH Remote controlling rclone with its API
.PP
If rclone is run with the \f[C]--rc\f[R] flag then it starts an HTTP
server which can be used to remote control rclone using its API.
.PP
You can either use the rclone rc command to access the API or use HTTP
directly.
.PP
If you just want to run a remote control then see the rcd
command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).
.SS Supported parameters
.SS --rc
.PP
Flag to start the http server listen on remote requests

.SS --rc-client-ca=PATH
.PP
Client certificate authority to verify clients with
.SS --rc-htpasswd=PATH
.PP

.PP
Timeout for server reading data (default 1h0m0s)
.SS --rc-server-write-timeout=DURATION
.PP
Timeout for server writing data (default 1h0m0s)
.SS --rc-serve
.PP
Enable the serving of remote objects via the HTTP interface.
This means objects will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5572/ by
default, so you can browse to http://127.0.0.1:5572/ or
http://127.0.0.1:5572/* to see a listing of the remotes.
Objects may be requested from remotes using this syntax
http://127.0.0.1:5572/[remote:path]/path/to/object
.PP
Default Off.
.SS --rc-files /path/to/directory
.PP
Path to local files to serve on the HTTP server.
.PP
If this is set then rclone will serve the files in that directory.
It will also open the root in the web browser if specified.
This is for implementing browser based GUIs for rclone functions.
.PP
If \f[C]--rc-user\f[R] or \f[C]--rc-pass\f[R] is set then the URL that
is opened will have the authorization in the URL in the
\f[C]http://user:pass\[at]localhost/\f[R] style.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS --rc-enable-metrics
.PP
Enable OpenMetrics/Prometheus compatible endpoint at \f[C]/metrics\f[R].
.PP
Default Off.
.SS --rc-web-gui
.PP
Set this flag to serve the default web gui on the same port as rclone.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS --rc-allow-origin
.PP
Set the allowed Access-Control-Allow-Origin for rc requests.
.PP
Can be used with --rc-web-gui if the rclone is running on different IP
than the web-gui.
.PP
Default is IP address on which rc is running.
.SS --rc-web-fetch-url
.PP
Set the URL to fetch the rclone-web-gui files from.
.PP
Default
https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/latest.
.SS --rc-web-gui-update
.PP
Set this flag to check and update rclone-webui-react from the
rc-web-fetch-url.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS --rc-web-gui-force-update
.PP
Set this flag to force update rclone-webui-react from the
rc-web-fetch-url.

Set this flag to disable opening browser automatically when using
web-gui.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS --rc-job-expire-duration=DURATION
.PP
Expire finished async jobs older than DURATION (default 60s).
.SS --rc-job-expire-interval=DURATION
.PP
Interval duration to check for expired async jobs (default 10s).
.SS --rc-no-auth
.PP
By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on the
rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone
remotes.
Eg \f[C]operations/list\f[R] is denied as it involved creating a remote
as is \f[C]sync/copy\f[R].
.PP
If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to
use these methods.
The alternative is to use \f[C]--rc-user\f[R] and \f[C]--rc-pass\f[R]
and use these credentials in the request.
.PP
Default Off.
.SS Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command
.PP
Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its
\f[C]rclone rc\f[R] command.
.PP
You can use it like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc rc/noop param1=one param2=two
{
    \[dq]param1\[dq]: \[dq]one\[dq],
    \[dq]param2\[dq]: \[dq]two\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Run \f[C]rclone rc\f[R] on its own to see the help for the installed
remote control commands.
.SS JSON input
.PP
\f[C]rclone rc\f[R] also supports a \f[C]--json\f[R] flag which can be
used to send more complicated input parameters.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc --json \[aq]{ \[dq]p1\[dq]: [1,\[dq]2\[dq],null,4], \[dq]p2\[dq]: { \[dq]a\[dq]:1, \[dq]b\[dq]:2 } }\[aq] rc/noop
{
    \[dq]p1\[dq]: [
        1,
        \[dq]2\[dq],
        null,
        4
    ],
    \[dq]p2\[dq]: {
        \[dq]a\[dq]: 1,
        \[dq]b\[dq]: 2
    }
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If the parameter being passed is an object then it can be passed as a
JSON string rather than using the \f[C]--json\f[R] flag which simplifies
the command line.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc operations/list fs=/tmp remote=test opt=\[aq]{\[dq]showHash\[dq]: true}\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Rather than
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc operations/list --json \[aq]{\[dq]fs\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp\[dq], \[dq]remote\[dq]: \[dq]test\[dq], \[dq]opt\[dq]: {\[dq]showHash\[dq]: true}}\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Special parameters
.PP
The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to
\f[B]all\f[R] commands.
These start with \f[C]_\f[R] to show they are different.
.SS Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true
.PP
Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id.
By default jobs are executed immediately as they are created or
synchronously.
.PP
If \f[C]_async\f[R] has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it
will return immediately with a job id and the task will be run in the
background.
The \f[C]job/status\f[R] call can be used to get information of the
background job.
The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after it has finished.
.PP
It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, e.g.
\f[C]sync/sync\f[R], \f[C]sync/copy\f[R], \f[C]sync/move\f[R],
\f[C]operations/purge\f[R] are run with the \f[C]_async\f[R] flag to
avoid any potential problems with the HTTP request and response timing
out.
.PP
Starting a job with the \f[C]_async\f[R] flag:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc --json \[aq]{ \[dq]p1\[dq]: [1,\[dq]2\[dq],null,4], \[dq]p2\[dq]: { \[dq]a\[dq]:1, \[dq]b\[dq]:2 }, \[dq]_async\[dq]: true }\[aq] rc/noop
{
    \[dq]jobid\[dq]: 2
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Query the status to see if the job has finished.
For more information on the meaning of these return parameters see the
\f[C]job/status\f[R] call.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc --json \[aq]{ \[dq]jobid\[dq]:2 }\[aq] job/status
{
    \[dq]duration\[dq]: 0.000124163,

    \[dq]success\[dq]: true
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]job/list\f[R] can be used to show the running or recently completed
jobs
.IP

.SS Setting config flags with _config
.PP
If you wish to set config (the equivalent of the global flags) for the
duration of an rc call only then pass in the \f[C]_config\f[R]
parameter.
.PP
This should be in the same format as the \f[C]config\f[R] key returned
by options/get.
.PP
For example, if you wished to run a sync with the \f[C]--checksum\f[R]
parameter, you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[dq]_config\[dq]:{\[dq]CheckSum\[dq]: true}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If using \f[C]rclone rc\f[R] this could be passed as
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc operations/sync ... _config=\[aq]{\[dq]CheckSum\[dq]: true}\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Any config parameters you don\[aq]t set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.
.PP
Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers - see
data types for more info.
Here is an example setting the equivalent of \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] in
string or integer format.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[dq]_config\[dq]:{\[dq]BufferSize\[dq]: \[dq]42M\[dq]}
\[dq]_config\[dq]:{\[dq]BufferSize\[dq]: 44040192}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you wish to check the \f[C]_config\f[R] assignment has worked
properly then calling \f[C]options/local\f[R] will show what the value
got set to.
.SS Setting filter flags with _filter
.PP
If you wish to set filters for the duration of an rc call only then pass
in the \f[C]_filter\f[R] parameter.
.PP
This should be in the same format as the \f[C]filter\f[R] key returned
by options/get.
.PP
For example, if you wished to run a sync with these flags
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--max-size 1M --max-age 42s --include \[dq]a\[dq] --include \[dq]b\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[dq]_filter\[dq]:{\[dq]MaxSize\[dq]:\[dq]1M\[dq], \[dq]IncludeRule\[dq]:[\[dq]a\[dq],\[dq]b\[dq]], \[dq]MaxAge\[dq]:\[dq]42s\[dq]}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If using \f[C]rclone rc\f[R] this could be passed as
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc ... _filter=\[aq]{\[dq]MaxSize\[dq]:\[dq]1M\[dq], \[dq]IncludeRule\[dq]:[\[dq]a\[dq],\[dq]b\[dq]], \[dq]MaxAge\[dq]:\[dq]42s\[dq]}\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Any filter parameters you don\[aq]t set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.
.PP
Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers - see
data types for more info.
Here is an example setting the equivalent of \f[C]--buffer-size\f[R] in
string or integer format.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[dq]_filter\[dq]:{\[dq]MinSize\[dq]: \[dq]42M\[dq]}
\[dq]_filter\[dq]:{\[dq]MinSize\[dq]: 44040192}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you wish to check the \f[C]_filter\f[R] assignment has worked
properly then calling \f[C]options/local\f[R] will show what the value
got set to.
.SS Assigning operations to groups with _group = value
.PP
Each rc call has its own stats group for tracking its metrics.
By default grouping is done by the composite group name from prefix
\f[C]job/\f[R] and id of the job like so \f[C]job/1\f[R].
.PP
If \f[C]_group\f[R] has a value then stats for that request will be
grouped under that value.
This allows caller to group stats under their own name.
.PP
Stats for specific group can be accessed by passing \f[C]group\f[R] to
\f[C]core/stats\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc --json \[aq]{ \[dq]group\[dq]: \[dq]job/1\[dq] }\[aq] core/stats
{
    \[dq]speed\[dq]: 12345
    ...
}
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Data types
.PP
When the API returns types, these will mostly be straight forward
integer, string or boolean types.
.PP
However some of the types returned by the options/get call and taken by
the options/set calls as well as the \f[C]vfsOpt\f[R],
\f[C]mountOpt\f[R] and the \f[C]_config\f[R] parameters.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]Duration\f[R] - these are returned as an integer duration in
nanoseconds.
They may be set as an integer, or they may be set with time string, eg
\[dq]5s\[dq].
See the options section (https://rclone.org/docs/#options) for more
info.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]Size\f[R] - these are returned as an integer number of bytes.
They may be set as an integer or they may be set with a size suffix
string, eg \[dq]10M\[dq].
See the options section (https://rclone.org/docs/#options) for more
info.
.IP \[bu] 2
Enumerated type (such as \f[C]CutoffMode\f[R], \f[C]DumpFlags\f[R],
\f[C]LogLevel\f[R], \f[C]VfsCacheMode\f[R] - these will be returned as
an integer and may be set as an integer but more conveniently they can
be set as a string, eg \[dq]HARD\[dq] for \f[C]CutoffMode\f[R] or
\f[C]DEBUG\f[R] for \f[C]LogLevel\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]BandwidthSpec\f[R] - this will be set and returned as a string, eg
\[dq]1M\[dq].
.SS Specifying remotes to work on
.PP
Remotes are specified with the \f[C]fs=\f[R], \f[C]srcFs=\f[R],
\f[C]dstFs=\f[R] parameters depending on the command being used.
.PP
The parameters can be a string as per the rest of rclone, eg
\f[C]s3:bucket/path\f[R] or \f[C]:sftp:/my/dir\f[R].
They can also be specified as JSON blobs.
.PP
If specifyng a JSON blob it should be a object mapping strings to
strings.
These values will be used to configure the remote.
There are 3 special values which may be set:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]type\f[R] - set to \f[C]type\f[R] to specify a remote called
\f[C]:type:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]_name\f[R] - set to \f[C]name\f[R] to specify a remote called
\f[C]name:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]_root\f[R] - sets the root of the remote - may be empty
.PP
One of \f[C]_name\f[R] or \f[C]type\f[R] should normally be set.
If the \f[C]local\f[R] backend is desired then \f[C]type\f[R] should be
set to \f[C]local\f[R].
If \f[C]_root\f[R] isn\[aq]t specified then it defaults to the root of
the remote.
.PP
For example this JSON is equivalent to \f[C]remote:/tmp\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]_name\[dq]: \[dq]remote\[dq],
    \[dq]_path\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And this is equivalent to
\f[C]:sftp,host=\[aq]example.com\[aq]:/tmp\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
    \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]example.com\[dq],
    \[dq]_path\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And this is equivalent to \f[C]/tmp/dir\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    type = \[dq]local\[dq],
    _ path = \[dq]/tmp/dir\[dq]
}

.PP
Returns:
.IP \[bu] 2
result - result from the backend command
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc backend/command command=noop fs=. -o echo=yes -o blue -a path1 -a path2
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Returns
.IP

            \[dq]echo\[dq]: \[dq]yes\[dq]
        }
    }
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that this is the direct equivalent of using this \[dq]backend\[dq]
command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend noop . -o echo=yes -o blue path1 path2
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that arguments must be preceded by the \[dq]-a\[dq] flag
.PP
See the backend (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command
for more information.
.PP
\f[B]Authentication is required for this call.\f[R]
.SS cache/expire: Purge a remote from cache
.PP
Purge a remote from the cache backend.
Supports either a directory or a file.
Params: - remote = path to remote (required) - withData = true/false to
delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional)
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc cache/expire remote=path/to/sub/folder/
rclone rc cache/expire remote=/ withData=true
\f[R]
.fi
.SS cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks
.PP
Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.
.PP
The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check.
It takes a comma separated list of array slice indices.
The slice indices are similar to Python slices: start[:end]
.PP
start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to
fetch inclusive.
end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to fetch
exclusive.
Both values can be negative, in which case they count from the back of
the file.
The value \[dq]-5:\[dq] represents the last 5 chunks of a file.
.PP
Some valid examples are: \[dq]:5,-5:\[dq] -> the first and last five
chunks \[dq]0,-2\[dq] -> the first and the second last chunk
\[dq]0:10\[dq] -> the first ten chunks
.PP
Any parameter with a key that starts with \[dq]file\[dq] can be used to
specify files to fetch, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc cache/fetch chunks=0 file=hello file2=home/goodbye
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
File names will automatically be encrypted when the a crypt remote is
used on top of the cache.
.SS cache/stats: Get cache stats
.PP
Show statistics for the cache remote.
.SS config/create: create the config for a remote.
.PP
This takes the following parameters:

.IP \[bu] 2
parameters - a map of { \[dq]key\[dq]: \[dq]value\[dq] } pairs
.IP \[bu] 2
type - type of the new remote
.IP \[bu] 2
opt - a dictionary of options to control the configuration
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
obscure - declare passwords are plain and need obscuring
.IP \[bu] 2
noObscure - declare passwords are already obscured and don\[aq]t need

.SS Debugging rclone with pprof
.PP
If you use the \f[C]--rc\f[R] flag this will also enable the use of the
go profiling tools on the same port.
.PP
To use these, first install go (https://golang.org/doc/install).
.SS Debugging memory use
.PP
To profile rclone\[aq]s memory use you can run:

.SS Notes
.PP
\[S1] Dropbox supports its own custom
hash (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash).
This is an SHA256 sum of all the 4 MiB block SHA256s.
.PP
\[S2] SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and
\f[C]md5sum\f[R] or \f[C]sha1sum\f[R] as well as \f[C]echo\f[R] are in
the remote\[aq]s PATH.
.PP
\[S3] WebDAV supports hashes when used with Owncloud and Nextcloud only.
.PP
\[u2074] WebDAV supports modtimes when used with Owncloud and Nextcloud
only.
.PP
\[u2075] Microsoft OneDrive Personal supports SHA1 hashes, whereas
OneDrive for business and SharePoint server support Microsoft\[aq]s own
QuickXorHash (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash).
.PP
\[u2076] Mail.ru uses its own modified SHA1 hash
.PP
\[u2077] pCloud only supports SHA1 (not MD5) in its EU region
.PP
\[u2078] Opendrive does not support creation of duplicate files using
their web client interface or other stock clients, but the underlying
storage platform has been determined to allow duplicate files, and it is
possible to create them with \f[C]rclone\f[R].
It may be that this is a mistake or an unsupported feature.
.SS Hash
.PP
The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects.
The hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and can
be specifically used with the \f[C]--checksum\f[R] flag in syncs and in
the \f[C]check\f[R] command.
.PP
To use the verify checksums when transferring between cloud storage
systems they must support a common hash type.
.SS ModTime
.PP
The cloud storage system supports setting modification times on objects.
If it does then this enables a using the modification times as part of
the sync.
If not then only the size will be checked by default, though the MD5SUM
can be checked with the \f[C]--checksum\f[R] flag.
.PP
All cloud storage systems support some kind of date on the object and
these will be set when transferring from the cloud storage system.
.SS Case Insensitive
.PP
If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to have
two files which differ only in case, e.g.
\f[C]file.txt\f[R] and \f[C]FILE.txt\f[R].
If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that isn\[aq]t
possible.
.PP
This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive system
and a case sensitive system.
The symptom of this is that no matter how many times you run the sync it
never completes fully.
.PP
The local filesystem and SFTP may or may not be case sensitive depending
on OS.
.IP \[bu] 2
Windows - usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
.IP \[bu] 2
OSX - usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case
sensitive
.IP \[bu] 2
Linux - usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file
systems (e.g.
FAT formatted USB keys)
.PP
Most of the time this doesn\[aq]t cause any problems as people tend to
avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive
systems.
.SS Duplicate files
.PP
If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.
.PP
This confuses rclone greatly when syncing - use the
\f[C]rclone dedupe\f[R] command to rename or remove duplicates.
.SS Restricted filenames
.PP
Some cloud storage systems might have restrictions on the characters
that are usable in file or directory names.
When \f[C]rclone\f[R] detects such a name during a file upload, it will
transparently replace the restricted characters with similar looking
Unicode characters.
To handle the different sets of restricted characters for different
backends, rclone uses something it calls encoding.
.PP
This process is designed to avoid ambiguous file names as much as
possible and allow to move files between many cloud storage systems
transparently.
.PP
The name shown by \f[C]rclone\f[R] to the user or during log output will
only contain a minimal set of replaced characters to ensure correct
formatting and not necessarily the actual name used on the cloud
storage.
.PP
This transformation is reversed when downloading a file or parsing
\f[C]rclone\f[R] arguments.
For example, when uploading a file named \f[C]my file?.txt\f[R] to
Onedrive, it will be displayed as \f[C]my file?.txt\f[R] on the console,
but stored as \f[C]my file\[uFF1F].txt\f[R] to Onedrive (the \f[C]?\f[R]
gets replaced by the similar looking \f[C]\[uFF1F]\f[R] character, the
so-called \[dq]fullwidth question mark\[dq]).
The reverse transformation allows to read a file
\f[C]unusual/name.txt\f[R] from Google Drive, by passing the name
\f[C]unusual\[uFF0F]name.txt\f[R] on the command line (the \f[C]/\f[R]
needs to be replaced by the similar looking \f[C]\[uFF0F]\f[R]
character).
.SS Caveats
.PP
The filename encoding system works well in most cases, at least where
file names are written in English or similar languages.
You might not even notice it: It just works.
In some cases it may lead to issues, though.
E.g.
when file names are written in Chinese, or Japanese, where it is always
the Unicode fullwidth variants of the punctuation marks that are used.
.PP
On Windows, the characters \f[C]:\f[R], \f[C]*\f[R] and \f[C]?\f[R] are
examples of restricted characters.
If these are used in filenames on a remote that supports it, Rclone will
transparently convert them to their fullwidth Unicode variants
\f[C]\[uFF0A]\f[R], \f[C]\[uFF1F]\f[R] and \f[C]\[uFF1A]\f[R] when
downloading to Windows, and back again when uploading.
This way files with names that are not allowed on Windows can still be
stored.
.PP
However, if you have files on your Windows system originally with these
same Unicode characters in their names, they will be included in the
same conversion process.
E.g.
if you create a file in your Windows filesystem with name
\f[C]Test\[uFF1A]1.jpg\f[R], where \f[C]\[uFF1A]\f[R] is the Unicode
fullwidth colon symbol, and use rclone to upload it to Google Drive,
which supports regular \f[C]:\f[R] (halfwidth question mark), rclone
will replace the fullwidth \f[C]:\f[R] with the halfwidth \f[C]:\f[R]
and store the file as \f[C]Test:1.jpg\f[R] in Google Drive.
Since both Windows and Google Drive allows the name
\f[C]Test\[uFF1A]1.jpg\f[R], it would probably be better if rclone just
kept the name as is in this case.
.PP
With the opposite situation; if you have a file named
\f[C]Test:1.jpg\f[R], in your Google Drive, e.g.
uploaded from a Linux system where \f[C]:\f[R] is valid in file names.
Then later use rclone to copy this file to your Windows computer you
will notice that on your local disk it gets renamed to
\f[C]Test\[uFF1A]1.jpg\f[R].
The original filename is not legal on Windows, due to the \f[C]:\f[R],
and rclone therefore renames it to make the copy possible.
That is all good.
However, this can also lead to an issue: If you already had a
\f[I]different\f[R] file named \f[C]Test\[uFF1A]1.jpg\f[R] on Windows,
and then use rclone to copy either way.
Rclone will then treat the file originally named \f[C]Test:1.jpg\f[R] on
Google Drive and the file originally named \f[C]Test\[uFF1A]1.jpg\f[R]
on Windows as the same file, and replace the contents from one with the
other.
.PP
Its virtually impossible to handle all cases like these correctly in all
situations, but by customizing the encoding option, changing the set of
characters that rclone should convert, you should be able to create a
configuration that works well for your specific situation.
See also the
example (https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding-example-windows) below.
.PP
(Windows was used as an example of a file system with many restricted
characters, and Google drive a storage system with few.)
.SS Default restricted characters
.PP
The table below shows the characters that are replaced by default.
.PP
When a replacement character is found in a filename, this character will
be escaped with the \f[C]\[u201B]\f[R] character to avoid ambiguous file
names.
(e.g.
a file named \f[C]\[u2400].txt\f[R] would shown as
\f[C]\[u201B]\[u2400].txt\f[R])
.PP
Each cloud storage backend can use a different set of characters, which
will be specified in the documentation for each backend.

.SS Invalid UTF-8 bytes
.PP
Some backends only support a sequence of well formed UTF-8 bytes as file
or directory names.
.PP
In this case all invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced with a quoted
representation of the byte value to allow uploading a file to such a
backend.
For example, the invalid byte \f[C]0xFE\f[R] will be encoded as
\f[C]\[u201B]FE\f[R].
.PP
A common source of invalid UTF-8 bytes are local filesystems, that store
names in a different encoding than UTF-8 or UTF-16, like latin1.
See the local filenames (https://rclone.org/local/#filenames) section
for details.
.SS Encoding option
.PP
Most backends have an encoding option, specified as a flag
\f[C]--backend-encoding\f[R] where \f[C]backend\f[R] is the name of the
backend, or as a config parameter \f[C]encoding\f[R] (you\[aq]ll need to
select the Advanced config in \f[C]rclone config\f[R] to see it).
.PP
This will have default value which encodes and decodes characters in
such a way as to preserve the maximum number of characters (see above).
.PP
However this can be incorrect in some scenarios, for example if you have
a Windows file system with Unicode fullwidth characters
\f[C]\[uFF0A]\f[R], \f[C]\[uFF1F]\f[R] or \f[C]\[uFF1A]\f[R], that you
want to remain as those characters on the remote rather than being
translated to regular (halfwidth) \f[C]*\f[R], \f[C]?\f[R] and
\f[C]:\f[R].
.PP
The \f[C]--backend-encoding\f[R] flags allow you to change that.
You can disable the encoding completely with
\f[C]--backend-encoding None\f[R] or set \f[C]encoding = None\f[R] in
the config file.
.PP
Encoding takes a comma separated list of encodings.
You can see the list of all possible values by passing an invalid value
to this flag, e.g.
\f[C]--local-encoding \[dq]help\[dq]\f[R].
The command \f[C]rclone help flags encoding\f[R] will show you the
defaults for the backends.

.SS Encoding example: FTP
.PP
To take a specific example, the FTP backend\[aq]s default encoding is
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--ftp-encoding \[dq]Slash,Del,Ctl,RightSpace,Dot\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, let\[aq]s say the FTP server is running on Windows and
can\[aq]t have any of the invalid Windows characters in file names.
You are backing up Linux servers to this FTP server which do have those
characters in file names.
So you would add the Windows set which are
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
to the existing ones, giving:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot,Del,RightSpace
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This can be specified using the \f[C]--ftp-encoding\f[R] flag or using
an \f[C]encoding\f[R] parameter in the config file.
.SS Encoding example: Windows
.PP
As a nother example, take a Windows system where there is a file with
name \f[C]Test\[uFF1A]1.jpg\f[R], where \f[C]\[uFF1A]\f[R] is the
Unicode fullwidth colon symbol.
When using rclone to copy this to a remote which supports \f[C]:\f[R],
the regular (halfwidth) colon (such as Google Drive), you will notice
that the file gets renamed to \f[C]Test:1.jpg\f[R].
.PP
To avoid this you can change the set of characters rclone should convert
for the local filesystem, using command-line argument
\f[C]--local-encoding\f[R].
Rclone\[aq]s default behavior on Windows corresponds to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--local-encoding \[dq]Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you want to use fullwidth characters \f[C]\[uFF1A]\f[R],
\f[C]\[uFF0A]\f[R] and \f[C]\[uFF1F]\f[R] in your filenames without
rclone changing them when uploading to a remote, then set the same as
the default value but without \f[C]Colon,Question,Asterisk\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--local-encoding \[dq]Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Alternatively, you can disable the conversion of any characters with
\f[C]--local-encoding None\f[R].
.PP
Instead of using command-line argument \f[C]--local-encoding\f[R], you
may also set it as environment
variable (https://rclone.org/docs/#environment-variables)
\f[C]RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING\f[R], or
configure (https://rclone.org/docs/#configure) a remote of type
\f[C]local\f[R] in your config, and set the \f[C]encoding\f[R] option
there.
.PP
The risk by doing this is that if you have a filename with the regular
(halfwidth) \f[C]:\f[R], \f[C]*\f[R] and \f[C]?\f[R] in your cloud
storage, and you try to download it to your Windows filesystem, this
will fail.
These characters are not valid in filenames on Windows, and you have
told rclone not to work around this by converting them to valid
fullwidth variants.
.SS MIME Type
.PP
MIME types (also known as media types) classify types of documents using
a simple text classification, e.g.
\f[C]text/html\f[R] or \f[C]application/pdf\f[R].
.PP
Some cloud storage systems support reading (\f[C]R\f[R]) the MIME type
of objects and some support writing (\f[C]W\f[R]) the MIME type of
objects.
.PP
The MIME type can be important if you are serving files directly to HTTP
from the storage system.
.PP
If you are copying from a remote which supports reading (\f[C]R\f[R]) to
a remote which supports writing (\f[C]W\f[R]) then rclone will preserve
the MIME types.
Otherwise they will be guessed from the extension, or the remote itself
may assign the MIME type.
.SS Optional Features
.PP
All rclone remotes support a base command set.
Other features depend upon backend-specific capabilities.

.TE
.SS Purge
.PP
This deletes a directory quicker than just deleting all the files in the
directory.
.PP
\[dg] Note Swift, Hubic, and Storj implement this in order to delete
directory markers but they don\[aq]t actually have a quicker way of
deleting files other than deleting them individually.
.PP
\[dd] StreamUpload is not supported with Nextcloud
.SS Copy
.PP
Used when copying an object to and from the same remote.
This known as a server-side copy so you can copy a file without
downloading it and uploading it again.
It is used if you use \f[C]rclone copy\f[R] or \f[C]rclone move\f[R] if
the remote doesn\[aq]t support \f[C]Move\f[R] directly.
.PP
If the server doesn\[aq]t support \f[C]Copy\f[R] directly then for copy
operations the file is downloaded then re-uploaded.
.SS Move
.PP
Used when moving/renaming an object on the same remote.
This is known as a server-side move of a file.
This is used in \f[C]rclone move\f[R] if the server doesn\[aq]t support
\f[C]DirMove\f[R].
.PP
If the server isn\[aq]t capable of \f[C]Move\f[R] then rclone simulates
it with \f[C]Copy\f[R] then delete.
If the server doesn\[aq]t support \f[C]Copy\f[R] then rclone will
download the file and re-upload it.
.SS DirMove
.PP
This is used to implement \f[C]rclone move\f[R] to move a directory if
possible.
If it isn\[aq]t then it will use \f[C]Move\f[R] on each file (which
falls back to \f[C]Copy\f[R] then download and upload - see
\f[C]Move\f[R] section).
.SS CleanUp
.PP
This is used for emptying the trash for a remote by
\f[C]rclone cleanup\f[R].
.PP
If the server can\[aq]t do \f[C]CleanUp\f[R] then
\f[C]rclone cleanup\f[R] will return an error.
.PP
\[dd]\[dd] Note that while Box implements this it has to delete every
file individually so it will be slower than emptying the trash via the
WebUI
.SS ListR
.PP
The remote supports a recursive list to list all the contents beneath a
directory quickly.
This enables the \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] flag to work.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS StreamUpload
.PP
Some remotes allow files to be uploaded without knowing the file size in
advance.
This allows certain operations to work without spooling the file to
local disk first, e.g.
\f[C]rclone rcat\f[R].
.SS LinkSharing
.PP
Sets the necessary permissions on a file or folder and prints a link
that allows others to access them, even if they don\[aq]t have an
account on the particular cloud provider.
.SS About
.PP
Rclone \f[C]about\f[R] prints quota information for a remote.
Typical output includes bytes used, free, quota and in trash.
.PP
If a remote lacks about capability \f[C]rclone about remote:\f[R]returns
an error.
.PP
Backends without about capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount, or use policy \f[C]mfs\f[R] (most free space) as a member
of an rclone union remote.
.PP
See rclone about command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
.SS EmptyDir
.PP
The remote supports empty directories.
See Limitations (https://rclone.org/bugs/#limitations) for details.
Most Object/Bucket-based remotes do not support this.
.SH Global Flags
.PP
This describes the global flags available to every rclone command split
into two groups, non backend and backend flags.
.SS Non Backend Flags
.PP
These flags are available for every command.

.SH Docker Volume Plugin
.SS Introduction
.PP
Docker 1.9 has added support for creating named
volumes (https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) via command-line
interface (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/)
and mounting them in containers as a way to share data between them.
Since Docker 1.10 you can create named volumes with Docker
Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/) by descriptions in
docker-compose.yml (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volume-configuration-reference)
files for use by container groups on a single host.
As of Docker 1.12 volumes are supported by Docker
Swarm (https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/) included with
Docker Engine and created from descriptions in swarm compose
v3 (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference)
files for use with \f[I]swarm stacks\f[R] across multiple cluster nodes.
.PP
Docker Volume
Plugins (https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/) augment
the default \f[C]local\f[R] volume driver included in Docker with
stateful volumes shared across containers and hosts.
Unlike local volumes, your data will \f[I]not\f[R] be deleted when such
volume is removed.
Plugins can run managed by the docker daemon, as a native system service
(under systemd, \f[I]sysv\f[R] or \f[I]upstart\f[R]) or as a standalone
executable.
Rclone can run as docker volume plugin in all these modes.
It interacts with the local docker daemon via plugin
API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugin_api/) and handles
mounting of remote file systems into docker containers so it must run on
the same host as the docker daemon or on every Swarm node.
.SS Getting started
.PP
In the first example we will use the SFTP (https://rclone.org/sftp/)
rclone volume with Docker engine on a standalone Ubuntu machine.
.PP
Start from installing Docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
on the host.
.PP
The \f[I]FUSE\f[R] driver is a prerequisite for rclone mounting and
should be installed on host:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo apt-get -y install fuse
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Create two directories required by rclone docker plugin:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Install the managed rclone docker plugin for your architecture (here
\f[C]amd64\f[R]):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 args=\[dq]-v\[dq] --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions
docker plugin list
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Create your SFTP volume (https://rclone.org/sftp/#standard-options):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker volume create firstvolume -d rclone -o type=sftp -o sftp-host=_hostname_ -o sftp-user=_username_ -o sftp-pass=_password_ -o allow-other=true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that since all options are static, you don\[aq]t even have to run
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] or create the \f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] file (but
the \f[C]config\f[R] directory should still be present).
In the simplest case you can use \f[C]localhost\f[R] as
\f[I]hostname\f[R] and your SSH credentials as \f[I]username\f[R] and
\f[I]password\f[R].
You can also change the remote path to your home directory on the host,
for example \f[C]-o path=/home/username\f[R].
.PP
Time to create a test container and mount the volume into it:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker run --rm -it -v firstvolume:/mnt --workdir /mnt ubuntu:latest bash
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If all goes well, you will enter the new container and change right to
the mounted SFTP remote.
You can type \f[C]ls\f[R] to list the mounted directory or otherwise
play with it.
Type \f[C]exit\f[R] when you are done.
The container will stop but the volume will stay, ready to be reused.
When it\[aq]s not needed anymore, remove it:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker volume list
docker volume remove firstvolume
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Now let us try \f[B]something more elaborate\f[R]: Google
Drive (https://rclone.org/drive/) volume on multi-node Docker Swarm.
.PP
You should start from installing Docker and FUSE, creating plugin
directories and installing rclone plugin on \f[I]every\f[R] swarm node.
Then setup the Swarm (https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-mode/).
.PP
Google Drive volumes need an access token which can be setup via web
browser and will be periodically renewed by rclone.
The managed plugin cannot run a browser so we will use a technique
similar to the rclone setup on a headless
box (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/).
.PP
Run rclone config (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_create/) on
\f[I]another\f[R] machine equipped with \f[I]web browser\f[R] and
graphical user interface.
Create the Google Drive
remote (https://rclone.org/drive/#standard-options).
When done, transfer the resulting \f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] to the Swarm
cluster and save as
\f[C]/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config/rclone.conf\f[R] on
\f[I]every\f[R] node.
By default this location is accessible only to the root user so you will
need appropriate privileges.
The resulting config will look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[gdrive]
type = drive
scope = drive
drive_id = 1234567...
root_folder_id = 0Abcd...
token = {\[dq]access_token\[dq]:...}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Now create the file named \f[C]example.yml\f[R] with a swarm stack
description like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
version: \[aq]3\[aq]
services:
  heimdall:
    image: linuxserver/heimdall:latest
    ports: [8080:80]
    volumes: [configdata:/config]
volumes:
  configdata:
    driver: rclone
    driver_opts:
      remote: \[aq]gdrive:heimdall\[aq]
      allow_other: \[aq]true\[aq]
      vfs_cache_mode: full
      poll_interval: 0
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and run the stack:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker stack deploy example -c ./example.yml
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
After a few seconds docker will spread the parsed stack description over
cluster, create the \f[C]example_heimdall\f[R] service on port
\f[I]8080\f[R], run service containers on one or more cluster nodes and
request the \f[C]example_configdata\f[R] volume from rclone plugins on
the node hosts.
You can use the following commands to confirm results:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker service ls
docker service ps example_heimdall
docker volume ls
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Point your browser to \f[C]http://cluster.host.address:8080\f[R] and
play with the service.
Stop it with \f[C]docker stack remove example\f[R] when you are done.
Note that the \f[C]example_configdata\f[R] volume(s) created on demand
at the cluster nodes will not be automatically removed together with the
stack but stay for future reuse.
You can remove them manually by invoking the
\f[C]docker volume remove example_configdata\f[R] command on every node.
.SS Creating Volumes via CLI
.PP
Volumes can be created with docker volume
create (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/).
Here are a few examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker volume create vol1 -d rclone -o remote=storj: -o vfs-cache-mode=full
docker volume create vol2 -d rclone -o remote=:storj,access_grant=xxx:heimdall
docker volume create vol3 -d rclone -o type=storj -o path=heimdall -o storj-access-grant=xxx -o poll-interval=0
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note the \f[C]-d rclone\f[R] flag that tells docker to request volume
from the rclone driver.
This works even if you installed managed driver by its full name
\f[C]rclone/docker-volume-rclone\f[R] because you provided the
\f[C]--alias rclone\f[R] option.
.PP
Volumes can be inspected as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker volume list
docker volume inspect vol1
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Volume Configuration
.PP
Rclone flags and volume options are set via the \f[C]-o\f[R] flag to the
\f[C]docker volume create\f[R] command.
They include backend-specific parameters as well as mount and
\f[I]VFS\f[R] options.
Also there are a few special \f[C]-o\f[R] options: \f[C]remote\f[R],
\f[C]fs\f[R], \f[C]type\f[R], \f[C]path\f[R], \f[C]mount-type\f[R] and
\f[C]persist\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]remote\f[R] determines an existing remote name from the config
file, with trailing colon and optionally with a remote path.
See the full syntax in the rclone
documentation (https://rclone.org/docs/#syntax-of-remote-paths).
This option can be aliased as \f[C]fs\f[R] to prevent confusion with the
\f[I]remote\f[R] parameter of such backends as \f[I]crypt\f[R] or
\f[I]alias\f[R].
.PP
The \f[C]remote=:backend:dir/subdir\f[R] syntax can be used to create
on-the-fly (config-less)
remotes (https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir), while the
\f[C]type\f[R] and \f[C]path\f[R] options provide a simpler alternative
for this.
Using two split options
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
-o type=backend -o path=dir/subdir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
is equivalent to the combined syntax
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
-o remote=:backend:dir/subdir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
but is arguably easier to parameterize in scripts.
The \f[C]path\f[R] part is optional.
.PP
Mount and VFS
options (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_docker/#options) as
well as backend parameters (https://rclone.org/flags/#backend-flags) are
named like their twin command-line flags without the \f[C]--\f[R] CLI
prefix.
Optionally you can use underscores instead of dashes in option names.
For example, \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode full\f[R] becomes
\f[C]-o vfs-cache-mode=full\f[R] or \f[C]-o vfs_cache_mode=full\f[R].
Boolean CLI flags without value will gain the \f[C]true\f[R] value, e.g.
\f[C]--allow-other\f[R] becomes \f[C]-o allow-other=true\f[R] or
\f[C]-o allow_other=true\f[R].
.PP
Please note that you can provide parameters only for the backend
immediately referenced by the backend type of mounted \f[C]remote\f[R].
If this is a wrapping backend like \f[I]alias, chunker or crypt\f[R],
you cannot provide options for the referred to remote or backend.
This limitation is imposed by the rclone connection string parser.
The only workaround is to feed plugin with \f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] or
configure plugin arguments (see below).
.SS Special Volume Options
.PP
\f[C]mount-type\f[R] determines the mount method and in general can be
one of: \f[C]mount\f[R], \f[C]cmount\f[R], or \f[C]mount2\f[R].
This can be aliased as \f[C]mount_type\f[R].
It should be noted that the managed rclone docker plugin currently does
not support the \f[C]cmount\f[R] method and \f[C]mount2\f[R] is rarely
needed.
This option defaults to the first found method, which is usually
\f[C]mount\f[R] so you generally won\[aq]t need it.
.PP
\f[C]persist\f[R] is a reserved boolean (true/false) option.
In future it will allow to persist on-the-fly remotes in the plugin
\f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] file.
.SS Connection Strings
.PP
The \f[C]remote\f[R] value can be extended with connection
strings (https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings) as an alternative
way to supply backend parameters.
This is equivalent to the \f[C]-o\f[R] backend options with one
\f[I]syntactic difference\f[R].
Inside connection string the backend prefix must be dropped from
parameter names but in the \f[C]-o param=value\f[R] array it must be
present.
For instance, compare the following option array
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
-o remote=:sftp:/home -o sftp-host=localhost
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
with equivalent connection string:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
-o remote=:sftp,host=localhost:/home
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This difference exists because flag options \f[C]-o key=val\f[R] include
not only backend parameters but also mount/VFS flags and possibly other
settings.
Also it allows to discriminate the \f[C]remote\f[R] option from the
\f[C]crypt-remote\f[R] (or similarly named backend parameters) and
arguably simplifies scripting due to clearer value substitution.
.SS Using with Swarm or Compose
.PP
Both \f[I]Docker Swarm\f[R] and \f[I]Docker Compose\f[R] use
YAML (http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)-formatted text files to
describe groups (stacks) of containers, their properties, networks and
volumes.
\f[I]Compose\f[R] uses the compose
v2 (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volume-configuration-reference)
format, \f[I]Swarm\f[R] uses the compose
v3 (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference)
format.
They are mostly similar, differences are explained in the docker
documentation (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#upgrading).
.PP
Volumes are described by the children of the top-level
\f[C]volumes:\f[R] node.
Each of them should be named after its volume and have at least two
elements, the self-explanatory \f[C]driver: rclone\f[R] value and the
\f[C]driver_opts:\f[R] structure playing the same role as
\f[C]-o key=val\f[R] CLI flags:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
volumes:
  volume_name_1:
    driver: rclone
    driver_opts:
      remote: \[aq]gdrive:\[aq]
      allow_other: \[aq]true\[aq]
      vfs_cache_mode: full
      token: \[aq]{\[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]borrower\[dq], \[dq]expires\[dq]: \[dq]2021-12-31\[dq]}\[aq]
      poll_interval: 0
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Notice a few important details: - YAML prefers \f[C]_\f[R] in option
names instead of \f[C]-\f[R].
- YAML treats single and double quotes interchangeably.
Simple strings and integers can be left unquoted.
- Boolean values must be quoted like \f[C]\[aq]true\[aq]\f[R] or
\f[C]\[dq]false\[dq]\f[R] because these two words are reserved by YAML.
- The filesystem string is keyed with \f[C]remote\f[R] (or with
\f[C]fs\f[R]).
Normally you can omit quotes here, but if the string ends with colon,
you \f[B]must\f[R] quote it like
\f[C]remote: \[dq]storage_box:\[dq]\f[R].
- YAML is picky about surrounding braces in values as this is in fact
another syntax for key/value
mappings (http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2790832).
For example, JSON access tokens usually contain double quotes and
surrounding braces, so you must put them in single quotes.
.SS Installing as Managed Plugin
.PP
Docker daemon can install plugins from an image registry and run them
managed.
We maintain the
docker-volume-rclone (https://hub.docker.com/p/rclone/docker-volume-rclone/)
plugin image on Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com).
.PP
Rclone volume plugin requires \f[B]Docker Engine >= 19.03.15\f[R]
.PP
The plugin requires presence of two directories on the host before it
can be installed.
Note that plugin will \f[B]not\f[R] create them automatically.
By default they must exist on host at the following locations (though
you can tweak the paths): -
\f[C]/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config\f[R] is reserved for the
\f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] config file and \f[B]must\f[R] exist even if
it\[aq]s empty and the config file is not present.
- \f[C]/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache\f[R] holds the plugin state
file as well as optional VFS caches.
.PP
You can install managed
plugin (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/plugin_install/)
with default settings as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 --grant-all-permissions --alias rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[C]:amd64\f[R] part of the image specification after colon is
called a \f[I]tag\f[R].
Usually you will want to install the latest plugin for your
architecture.
In this case the tag will just name it, like \f[C]amd64\f[R] above.
The following plugin architectures are currently available: -
\f[C]amd64\f[R] - \f[C]arm64\f[R] - \f[C]arm-v7\f[R]
.PP
Sometimes you might want a concrete plugin version, not the latest one.
Then you should use image tag in the form
\f[C]:ARCHITECTURE-VERSION\f[R].
For example, to install plugin version \f[C]v1.56.2\f[R] on architecture
\f[C]arm64\f[R] you will use tag \f[C]arm64-1.56.2\f[R] (note the
removed \f[C]v\f[R]) so the full image specification becomes
\f[C]rclone/docker-volume-rclone:arm64-1.56.2\f[R].
.PP
We also provide the \f[C]latest\f[R] plugin tag, but since docker does
not support multi-architecture plugins as of the time of this writing,
this tag is currently an \f[B]alias for \f[CB]amd64\f[B]\f[R].
By convention the \f[C]latest\f[R] tag is the default one and can be
omitted, thus both \f[C]rclone/docker-volume-rclone:latest\f[R] and just
\f[C]rclone/docker-volume-rclone\f[R] will refer to the latest plugin
release for the \f[C]amd64\f[R] platform.
.PP
Also the \f[C]amd64\f[R] part can be omitted from the versioned rclone
plugin tags.
For example, rclone image reference
\f[C]rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64-1.56.2\f[R] can be abbreviated as
\f[C]rclone/docker-volume-rclone:1.56.2\f[R] for convenience.
However, for non-intel architectures you still have to use the full tag
as \f[C]amd64\f[R] or \f[C]latest\f[R] will fail to start.
.PP
Managed plugin is in fact a special container running in a namespace
separate from normal docker containers.
Inside it runs the \f[C]rclone serve docker\f[R] command.
The config and cache directories are bind-mounted into the container at
start.
The docker daemon connects to a unix socket created by the command
inside the container.
The command creates on-demand remote mounts right inside, then docker
machinery propagates them through kernel mount namespaces and
bind-mounts into requesting user containers.
.PP
You can tweak a few plugin settings after installation when it\[aq]s
disabled (not in use), for instance:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker plugin disable rclone
docker plugin set rclone RCLONE_VERBOSE=2 config=/etc/rclone args=\[dq]--vfs-cache-mode=writes --allow-other\[dq]
docker plugin enable rclone
docker plugin inspect rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that if docker refuses to disable the plugin, you should find and
remove all active volumes connected with it as well as containers and
swarm services that use them.
This is rather tedious so please carefully plan in advance.
.PP
You can tweak the following settings: \f[C]args\f[R], \f[C]config\f[R],
\f[C]cache\f[R], \f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[R], \f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[R],
\f[C]NO_PROXY\f[R] and \f[C]RCLONE_VERBOSE\f[R].
It\[aq]s \f[I]your\f[R] task to keep plugin settings in sync across
swarm cluster nodes.
.PP
\f[C]args\f[R] sets command-line arguments for the
\f[C]rclone serve docker\f[R] command (\f[I]none\f[R] by default).
Arguments should be separated by space so you will normally want to put
them in quotes on the docker plugin
set (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/plugin_set/)
command line.
Both serve docker
flags (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_docker/#options) and
generic rclone flags (https://rclone.org/flags/) are supported,
including backend parameters that will be used as defaults for volume
creation.
Note that plugin will fail (due to this docker
bug (https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v20.10.7/plugin/v2/plugin.go#L195))
if the \f[C]args\f[R] value is empty.
Use e.g.
\f[C]args=\[dq]-v\[dq]\f[R] as a workaround.
.PP
\f[C]config=/host/dir\f[R] sets alternative host location for the config
directory.
Plugin will look for \f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] here.
It\[aq]s not an error if the config file is not present but the
directory must exist.
Please note that plugin can periodically rewrite the config file, for
example when it renews storage access tokens.
Keep this in mind and try to avoid races between the plugin and other
instances of rclone on the host that might try to change the config
simultaneously resulting in corrupted \f[C]rclone.conf\f[R].
You can also put stuff like private key files for SFTP remotes in this
directory.
Just note that it\[aq]s bind-mounted inside the plugin container at the
predefined path \f[C]/data/config\f[R].
For example, if your key file is named \f[C]sftp-box1.key\f[R] on the
host, the corresponding volume config option should read
\f[C]-o sftp-key-file=/data/config/sftp-box1.key\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]cache=/host/dir\f[R] sets alternative host location for the
\f[I]cache\f[R] directory.
The plugin will keep VFS caches here.
Also it will create and maintain the \f[C]docker-plugin.state\f[R] file
in this directory.
When the plugin is restarted or reinstalled, it will look in this file
to recreate any volumes that existed previously.
However, they will not be re-mounted into consuming containers after
restart.
Usually this is not a problem as the docker daemon normally will restart
affected user containers after failures, daemon restarts or host
reboots.
.PP
\f[C]RCLONE_VERBOSE\f[R] sets plugin verbosity from \f[C]0\f[R] (errors
only, by default) to \f[C]2\f[R] (debugging).
Verbosity can be also tweaked via \f[C]args=\[dq]-v [-v] ...\[dq]\f[R].
Since arguments are more generic, you will rarely need this setting.
The plugin output by default feeds the docker daemon log on local host.
Log entries are reflected as \f[I]errors\f[R] in the docker log but
retain their actual level assigned by rclone in the encapsulated message
string.
.PP
\f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[R], \f[C]HTTPS_PROXY\f[R], \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[R]
customize the plugin proxy settings.
.PP
You can set custom plugin options right when you install it, \f[I]in one
go\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker plugin remove rclone
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 \[rs]
       --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions \[rs]
       args=\[dq]-v --allow-other\[dq] config=/etc/rclone
docker plugin inspect rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Healthchecks
.PP
The docker plugin volume protocol doesn\[aq]t provide a way for plugins
to inform the docker daemon that a volume is (un-)available.
As a workaround you can setup a healthcheck to verify that the mount is
responding, for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
services:
  my_service:
    image: my_image
    healthcheck:
      test: ls /path/to/rclone/mount || exit 1
      interval: 1m
      timeout: 15s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 15s
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Running Plugin under Systemd
.PP
In most cases you should prefer managed mode.
Moreover, MacOS and Windows do not support native Docker plugins.
Please use managed mode on these systems.
Proceed further only if you are on Linux.
.PP
First, install rclone (https://rclone.org/install/).
You can just run it (type \f[C]rclone serve docker\f[R] and hit enter)
for the test.
.PP
Install \f[I]FUSE\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo apt-get -y install fuse
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Download two systemd configuration files:
docker-volume-rclone.service (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rclone/rclone/master/contrib/docker-plugin/systemd/docker-volume-rclone.service)
and
docker-volume-rclone.socket (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rclone/rclone/master/contrib/docker-plugin/systemd/docker-volume-rclone.socket).
.PP
Put them to the \f[C]/etc/systemd/system/\f[R] directory:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cp docker-volume-plugin.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp docker-volume-plugin.socket  /etc/systemd/system/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Please note that all commands in this section must be run as
\f[I]root\f[R] but we omit \f[C]sudo\f[R] prefix for brevity.
Now create directories required by the service:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Run the docker plugin service in the socket activated mode:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service
systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.socket
systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.socket
systemctl restart docker
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or run the service directly: - run \f[C]systemctl daemon-reload\f[R] to
let systemd pick up new config - run
\f[C]systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.service\f[R] to make the new
service start automatically when you power on your machine.
- run \f[C]systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service\f[R] to start
the service now.
- run \f[C]systemctl restart docker\f[R] to restart docker daemon and
let it detect the new plugin socket.
Note that this step is not needed in managed mode where docker knows
about plugin state changes.
.PP
The two methods are equivalent from the user perspective, but I
personally prefer socket activation.
.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
You can see managed plugin
settings (https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/#debugging-plugins) with
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker plugin list
docker plugin inspect rclone
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that docker (including latest 20.10.7) will not show actual values
of \f[C]args\f[R], just the defaults.
.PP
Use \f[C]journalctl --unit docker\f[R] to see managed plugin output as
part of the docker daemon log.
Note that docker reflects plugin lines as \f[I]errors\f[R] but their
actual level can be seen from encapsulated message string.
.PP
You will usually install the latest version of managed plugin for your
platform.
Use the following commands to print the actual installed version:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PLUGID=$(docker plugin list --no-trunc | awk \[aq]/rclone/{print$1}\[aq])
sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec $PLUGID rclone version
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can even use \f[C]runc\f[R] to run shell inside the plugin
container:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec --tty $PLUGID bash
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Also you can use curl to check the plugin socket connectivity:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker plugin list --no-trunc
PLUGID=123abc...
sudo curl -H Content-Type:application/json -XPOST -d {} --unix-socket /run/docker/plugins/$PLUGID/rclone.sock http://localhost/Plugin.Activate
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
though this is rarely needed.
.SS Caveats
.PP
Finally I\[aq]d like to mention a \f[I]caveat with updating volume
settings\f[R].
Docker CLI does not have a dedicated command like
\f[C]docker volume update\f[R].
It may be tempting to invoke \f[C]docker volume create\f[R] with updated
options on existing volume, but there is a gotcha.
The command will do nothing, it won\[aq]t even return an error.
I hope that docker maintainers will fix this some day.
In the meantime be aware that you must remove your volume before
recreating it with new settings:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker volume remove my_vol
docker volume create my_vol -d rclone -o opt1=new_val1 ...
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and verify that settings did update:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
docker volume list
docker volume inspect my_vol
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If docker refuses to remove the volume, you should find containers or
swarm services that use it and stop them first.
.SS Getting started

$ rclone bisync --help
Usage:
  rclone bisync remote1:path1 remote2:path2 [flags]

Positional arguments:
  Path1, Path2  Local path, or remote storage with \[aq]:\[aq] plus optional path.
                Type \[aq]rclone listremotes\[aq] for list of configured remotes.

Optional Flags:
      --check-access            Ensure expected \[ga]RCLONE_TEST\[ga] files are found on
                                both Path1 and Path2 filesystems, else abort.
      --check-filename FILENAME Filename for \[ga]--check-access\[ga] (default: \[ga]RCLONE_TEST\[ga])
      --check-sync CHOICE       Controls comparison of final listings:
                                \[ga]true | false | only\[ga] (default: true)
                                If set to \[ga]only\[ga], bisync will only compare listings
                                from the last run but skip actual sync.
      --filters-file PATH       Read filtering patterns from a file
      --max-delete PERCENT      Safety check on maximum percentage of deleted files allowed.
                                If exceeded, the bisync run will abort. (default: 50%)
      --force                   Bypass \[ga]--max-delete\[ga] safety check and run the sync.
                                Consider using with \[ga]--verbose\[ga]
      --remove-empty-dirs       Remove empty directories at the final cleanup step.
  -1, --resync                  Performs the resync run.
                                Warning: Path1 files may overwrite Path2 versions.
                                Consider using \[ga]--verbose\[ga] or \[ga]--dry-run\[ga] first.
      --localtime               Use local time in listings (default: UTC)
      --no-cleanup              Retain working files (useful for troubleshooting and testing).
      --workdir PATH            Use custom working directory (useful for testing).
                                (default: \[ga]\[ti]/.cache/rclone/bisync\[ga])
  -n, --dry-run                 Go through the motions - No files are copied/deleted.
  -v, --verbose                 Increases logging verbosity.
                                May be specified more than once for more details.
  -h, --help                    help for bisync
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Arbitrary rclone flags may be specified on the bisync command
line (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_bisync/), for example
\f[C]rclone bsync ./testdir/path1/ gdrive:testdir/path2/ --drive-skip-gdocs -v -v --timeout 10s\f[R]
Note that interactions of various rclone flags with bisync process flow
has not been fully tested yet.
.SS Paths
.PP
Path1 and Path2 arguments may be references to any mix of local
directory paths (absolute or relative), UNC paths
(\f[C]//server/share/path\f[R]), Windows drive paths (with a drive
letter and \f[C]:\f[R]) or configured
remotes (https://rclone.org/docs/#syntax-of-remote-paths) with optional
subdirectory paths.
Cloud references are distinguished by having a \f[C]:\f[R] in the
argument (see Windows support below).
.PP
Path1 and Path2 are treated equally, in that neither has priority for
file changes, and access efficiency does not change whether a remote is
on Path1 or Path2.
.PP
The listings in bisync working directory (default:
\f[C]\[ti]/.cache/rclone/bisync\f[R]) are named based on the Path1 and
Path2 arguments so that separate syncs to individual directories within
the tree may be set up, e.g.:
\f[C]path_to_local_tree..dropbox_subdir.lst\f[R].
.PP
Any empty directories after the sync on both the Path1 and Path2
filesystems are not deleted by default.
If the \f[C]--remove-empty-dirs\f[R] flag is specified, then both paths
will have any empty directories purged as the last step in the process.
.SS Command-line flags
.SS --resync
.PP
This will effectively make both Path1 and Path2 filesystems contain a
matching superset of all files.
Path2 files that do not exist in Path1 will be copied to Path1, and the
process will then sync the Path1 tree to Path2.
.PP
The base directories on the both Path1 and Path2 filesystems must exist
or bisync will fail.
This is required for safety - that bisync can verify that both paths are
valid.
.PP
When using \f[C]--resync\f[R] a newer version of a file on the Path2
filesystem will be overwritten by the Path1 filesystem version.
Carefully evaluate deltas using
--dry-run (https://rclone.org/flags/#non-backend-flags).
.PP
For a resync run, one of the paths may be empty (no files in the path
tree).
The resync run should result in files on both paths, else a normal
non-resync run will fail.
.PP
For a non-resync run, either path being empty (no files in the tree)
fails with
\f[C]Empty current PathN listing. Cannot sync to an empty directory: X.pathN.lst\f[R]
This is a safety check that an unexpected empty path does not result in
deleting \f[B]everything\f[R] in the other path.
.SS --check-access
.PP
Access check files are an additional safety measure against data loss.
bisync will ensure it can find matching \f[C]RCLONE_TEST\f[R] files in
the same places in the Path1 and Path2 filesystems.
Time stamps and file contents are not important, just the names and
locations.
Place one or more \f[C]RCLONE_TEST\f[R] files in the Path1 or Path2
filesystem and then do either a run without \f[C]--check-access\f[R] or
a \f[C]--resync\f[R] to set matching files on both filesystems.
If you have symbolic links in your sync tree it is recommended to place
\f[C]RCLONE_TEST\f[R] files in the linked-to directory tree to protect
against bisync assuming a bunch of deleted files if the linked-to tree
should not be accessible.
Also see the \f[C]--check-filename\f[R] flag.
.SS --max-delete
.PP
As a safety check, if greater than the \f[C]--max-delete\f[R] percent of
files were deleted on either the Path1 or Path2 filesystem, then bisync
will abort with a warning message, without making any changes.
The default \f[C]--max-delete\f[R] is \f[C]50%\f[R].
One way to trigger this limit is to rename a directory that contains
more than half of your files.
This will appear to bisync as a bunch of deleted files and a bunch of
new files.
This safety check is intended to block bisync from deleting all of the
files on both filesystems due to a temporary network access issue, or if
the user had inadvertently deleted the files on one side or the other.
To force the sync either set a different delete percentage limit, e.g.
\f[C]--max-delete 75\f[R] (allows up to 75% deletion), or use
\f[C]--force\f[R] to bypass the check.
.PP
Also see the all files changed check.
.SS --filters-file
.PP
By using rclone filter features you can exclude file types or directory
sub-trees from the sync.
See the bisync filters section and generic
--filter-from (https://rclone.org/filtering/#filter-from-read-filtering-patterns-from-a-file)
documentation.
An example filters file contains filters for non-allowed files for
synching with Dropbox.
.PP
If you make changes to your filters file then bisync requires a run with
\f[C]--resync\f[R].
This is a safety feature, which avoids existing files on the Path1
and/or Path2 side from seeming to disappear from view (since they are
excluded in the new listings), which would fool bisync into seeing them
as deleted (as compared to the prior run listings), and then bisync
would proceed to delete them for real.
.PP
To block this from happening bisync calculates an MD5 hash of the
filters file and stores the hash in a \f[C].md5\f[R] file in the same
place as your filters file.
On the next runs with \f[C]--filters-file\f[R] set, bisync re-calculates
the MD5 hash of the current filters file and compares it to the hash
stored in \f[C].md5\f[R] file.
If they don\[aq]t match the run aborts with a critical error and thus
forces you to do a \f[C]--resync\f[R], likely avoiding a disaster.
.SS --check-sync
.PP
Enabled by default, the check-sync function checks that all of the same
files exist in both the Path1 and Path2 history listings.
This \f[I]check-sync\f[R] integrity check is performed at the end of the
sync run by default.
Any untrapped failing copy/deletes between the two paths might result in
differences between the two listings and in the untracked file content
differences between the two paths.
A resync run would correct the error.
.PP
Note that the default-enabled integrity check locally executes a load of
both the final Path1 and Path2 listings, and thus adds to the run time
of a sync.
Using \f[C]--check-sync=false\f[R] will disable it and may significantly
reduce the sync run times for very large numbers of files.
.PP
The check may be run manually with \f[C]--check-sync=only\f[R].
It runs only the integrity check and terminates without actually
synching.
.SS Operation
.SS Runtime flow details
.PP
bisync retains the listings of the \f[C]Path1\f[R] and \f[C]Path2\f[R]
filesystems from the prior run.
On each successive run it will:
.IP \[bu] 2
list files on \f[C]path1\f[R] and \f[C]path2\f[R], and check for changes
on each side.
Changes include \f[C]New\f[R], \f[C]Newer\f[R], \f[C]Older\f[R], and
\f[C]Deleted\f[R] files.
.IP \[bu] 2
Propagate changes on \f[C]path1\f[R] to \f[C]path2\f[R], and vice-versa.
.SS Safety measures
.IP \[bu] 2
Lock file prevents multiple simultaneous runs when taking a while.
This can be particularly useful if bisync is run by cron scheduler.
.IP \[bu] 2
Handle change conflicts non-destructively by creating \f[C]..path1\f[R]
and \f[C]..path2\f[R] file versions.
.IP \[bu] 2
File system access health check using \f[C]RCLONE_TEST\f[R] files (see
the \f[C]--check-access\f[R] flag).
.IP \[bu] 2
Abort on excessive deletes - protects against a failed listing being
interpreted as all the files were deleted.
See the \f[C]--max-delete\f[R] and \f[C]--force\f[R] flags.
.IP \[bu] 2
If something evil happens, bisync goes into a safe state to block damage
by later runs.

.TE
.SS All files changed check
.PP
if \f[I]all\f[R] prior existing files on either of the filesystems have
changed (e.g.
timestamps have changed due to changing the system\[aq]s timezone) then
bisync will abort without making any changes.
Any new files are not considered for this check.
You could use \f[C]--force\f[R] to force the sync (whichever side has
the changed timestamp files wins).
Alternately, a \f[C]--resync\f[R] may be used (Path1 versions will be
pushed to Path2).
Consider the situation carefully and perhaps use \f[C]--dry-run\f[R]
before you commit to the changes.
.SS Modification time
.PP
Bisync relies on file timestamps to identify changed files and will
\f[I]refuse\f[R] to operate if backend lacks the modification time
support.
.PP
If you or your application should change the content of a file without
changing the modification time then bisync will \f[I]not\f[R] notice the
change, and thus will not copy it to the other side.
.PP
Note that on some cloud storage systems it is not possible to have file
timestamps that match \f[I]precisely\f[R] between the local and other
filesystems.
.PP
Bisync\[aq]s approach to this problem is by tracking the changes on each
side \f[I]separately\f[R] over time with a local database of files in
that side then applying the resulting changes on the other side.
.SS Error handling
.PP
Certain bisync critical errors, such as file copy/move failing, will
result in a bisync lockout of following runs.
The lockout is asserted because the sync status and history of the Path1
and Path2 filesystems cannot be trusted, so it is safer to block any
further changes until someone checks things out.
The recovery is to do a \f[C]--resync\f[R] again.
.PP
It is recommended to use \f[C]--resync --dry-run --verbose\f[R]
initially and \f[I]carefully\f[R] review what changes will be made
before running the \f[C]--resync\f[R] without \f[C]--dry-run\f[R].
.PP
Most of these events come up due to a error status from an internal
call.
On such a critical error the \f[C]{...}.path1.lst\f[R] and
\f[C]{...}.path2.lst\f[R] listing files are renamed to extension
\f[C].lst-err\f[R], which blocks any future bisync runs (since the
normal \f[C].lst\f[R] files are not found).
Bisync keeps them under \f[C]bisync\f[R] subdirectory of the rclone
cache direcory, typically at \f[C]${HOME}/.cache/rclone/bisync/\f[R] on
Linux.
.PP
Some errors are considered temporary and re-running the bisync is not
blocked.
The \f[I]critical return\f[R] blocks further bisync runs.
.SS Lock file
.PP
When bisync is running, a lock file is created in the bisync working
directory, typically at
\f[C]\[ti]/.cache/rclone/bisync/PATH1..PATH2.lck\f[R] on Linux.
If bisync should crash or hang, the lock file will remain in place and
block any further runs of bisync \f[I]for the same paths\f[R].
Delete the lock file as part of debugging the situation.
The lock file effectively blocks follow-on (e.g., scheduled by
\f[I]cron\f[R]) runs when the prior invocation is taking a long time.
The lock file contains \f[I]PID\f[R] of the blocking process, which may
help in debug.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R] that while concurrent bisync runs are allowed, \f[I]be
very cautious\f[R] that there is no overlap in the trees being synched
between concurrent runs, lest there be replicated files, deleted files
and general mayhem.
.SS Return codes
.PP
\f[C]rclone bisync\f[R] returns the following codes to calling program:
- \f[C]0\f[R] on a successful run, - \f[C]1\f[R] for a non-critical
failing run (a rerun may be successful), - \f[C]2\f[R] for a critically
aborted run (requires a \f[C]--resync\f[R] to recover).
.SS Limitations
.SS Supported backends
.PP
Bisync is considered \f[I]BETA\f[R] and has been tested with the
following backends: - Local filesystem - Google Drive - Dropbox -
OneDrive - S3 - SFTP
.PP
It has not been fully tested with other services yet.
If it works, or sorta works, please let us know and we\[aq]ll update the
list.
Run the test suite to check for proper operation as described below.
.PP
First release of \f[C]rclone bisync\f[R] requires that underlying
backend supported the modification time feature and will refuse to run
otherwise.
This limitation will be lifted in a future \f[C]rclone bisync\f[R]
release.
.SS Concurrent modifications
.PP
When using \f[B]Local, FTP or SFTP\f[R] remotes rclone does not create
\f[I]temporary\f[R] files at the destination when copying, and thus if
the connection is lost the created file may be corrupt, which will
likely propagate back to the original path on the next sync, resulting
in data loss.
This will be solved in a future release, there is no workaround at the
moment.
.PP
Files that \f[B]change during\f[R] a bisync run may result in data loss.
This has been seen in a highly dynamic environment, where the filesystem
is getting hammered by running processes during the sync.
The solution is to sync at quiet times or filter out unnecessary
directories and files.
.SS Empty directories
.PP
New empty directories on one path are \f[I]not\f[R] propagated to the
other side.
This is because bisync (and rclone) natively works on files not
directories.
The following sequence is a workaround but will not propagate the delete
of an empty directory to the other side:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone bisync PATH1 PATH2
rclone copy PATH1 PATH2 --filter \[dq]+ */\[dq] --filter \[dq]- **\[dq] --create-empty-src-dirs
rclone copy PATH2 PATH2 --filter \[dq]+ */\[dq] --filter \[dq]- **\[dq] --create-empty-src-dirs
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Renamed directories
.PP
Renaming a folder on the Path1 side results is deleting all files on the
Path2 side and then copying all files again from Path1 to Path2.
Bisync sees this as all files in the old directory name as deleted and
all files in the new directory name as new.
Similarly, renaming a directory on both sides to the same name will
result in creating \f[C]..path1\f[R] and \f[C]..path2\f[R] files on both
sides.
Currently the most effective and efficient method of renaming a
directory is to rename it on both sides, then do a \f[C]--resync\f[R].
.SS Case sensitivity
.PP
Synching with \f[B]case-insensitive\f[R] filesystems, such as Windows or
\f[C]Box\f[R], can result in file name conflicts.
This will be fixed in a future release.
The near term workaround is to make sure that files on both sides
don\[aq]t have spelling case differences (\f[C]Smile.jpg\f[R] vs.
\f[C]smile.jpg\f[R]).
.SS Windows support
.PP
Bisync has been tested on Windows 8.1, Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and on
Windows Github runners.
.PP
Drive letters are allowed, including drive letters mapped to network
drives (\f[C]rclone bisync J:\[rs]localsync GDrive:\f[R]).
If a drive letter is omitted, the shell current drive is the default.
Drive letters are a single character follows by \f[C]:\f[R], so cloud
names must be more than one character long.
.PP
Absolute paths (with or without a drive letter), and relative paths
(with or without a drive letter) are supported.
.PP
Working directory is created at
\f[C]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]MyLogin\[rs]AppData\[rs]Local\[rs]rclone\[rs]bisync\f[R].
.PP
Note that bisync output may show a mix of forward \f[C]/\f[R] and back
\f[C]\[rs]\f[R] slashes.
.PP
Be careful of case independent directory and file naming on Windows vs.
case dependent Linux
.SS Filtering
.PP
See filtering documentation (https://rclone.org/filtering/) for how
filter rules are written and interpreted.
.PP
Bisync\[aq]s \f[C]--filters-file\f[R] flag slightly extends the
rclone\[aq]s
--filter-from (https://rclone.org/filtering/#filter-from-read-filtering-patterns-from-a-file)
filtering mechanism.
For a given bisync run you may provide \f[I]only one\f[R]
\f[C]--filters-file\f[R].
The \f[C]--include*\f[R], \f[C]--exclude*\f[R], and \f[C]--filter\f[R]
flags are also supported.
.SS How to filter directories
.PP
Filtering portions of the directory tree is a critical feature for
synching.
.PP
Examples of directory trees (always beneath the Path1/Path2 root level)
you may want to exclude from your sync: - Directory trees containing
only software build intermediate files.
- Directory trees containing application temporary files and data such
as the Windows \f[C]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]MyLogin\[rs]AppData\[rs]\f[R] tree.
- Directory trees containing files that are large, less important, or
are getting thrashed continuously by ongoing processes.
.PP
On the other hand, there may be only select directories that you
actually want to sync, and exclude all others.
See the Example include-style filters for Windows user directories
below.
.SS Filters file writing guidelines
.IP "1." 3
Begin with excluding directory trees:
.RS 4
.IP \[bu] 2
e.g.
\[ga]- /AppData/\[ga]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]**\f[R] on the end is not necessary.
Once a given directory level is excluded then everything beneath it
won\[aq]t be looked at by rclone.
.IP \[bu] 2
Exclude such directories that are unneeded, are big, dynamically
thrashed, or where there may be access permission issues.
.IP \[bu] 2
Excluding such dirs first will make rclone operations (much) faster.
.IP \[bu] 2
Specific files may also be excluded, as with the Dropbox exclusions
example below.

They may be included with \[ga]+ /*\[ga].
.IP \[bu] 2
Place RCLONE_TEST files within these included directory trees.
They will only be looked for in these directory trees.

A few rules for the syntax of a filter file expanding on filtering
documentation (https://rclone.org/filtering/):
.IP \[bu] 2
Lines may start with spaces and tabs - rclone strips leading whitespace.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the first non-whitespace character is a \f[C]#\f[R] then the line is
a comment and will be ignored.
.IP \[bu] 2
Blank lines are ignored.
.IP \[bu] 2
The first non-whitespace character on a filter line must be a
\f[C]+\f[R] or \f[C]-\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Exactly 1 space is allowed between the \f[C]+/-\f[R] and the path term.
.IP \[bu] 2
Only forward slashes (\f[C]/\f[R]) are used in path terms, even on
Windows.
.IP \[bu] 2
The rest of the line is taken as the path term.
Trailing whitespace is taken literally, and probably is an error.
.SS Example include-style filters for Windows user directories
.PP
This Windows \f[I]include-style\f[R] example is based on the sync root
(Path1) set to \f[C]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]MyLogin\f[R].
The strategy is to select specific directories to be synched with a
network drive (Path2).
.IP \[bu] 2
\[ga]- /AppData/\[ga] excludes an entire tree of Windows stored stuff
that need not be synched.
In my case, AppData has >11 GB of stuff I don\[aq]t care about, and
there are some subdirectories beneath AppData that are not accessible to
my user login, resulting in bisync critical aborts.
.IP \[bu] 2
Windows creates cache files starting with both upper and lowercase
\f[C]NTUSER\f[R] at \f[C]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]MyLogin\f[R].
These files may be dynamic, locked, and are generally \f[I]don\[aq]t
care\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
There are just a few directories with \f[I]my\f[R] data that I do want
synched, in the form of \[ga]+
/\f[C]. By selecting only the directory trees I   want to avoid the dozen plus directories that various apps make   at\f[R]C:\[ga].
.IP \[bu] 2
Include files in the root of the sync point,
\f[C]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]MyLogin\f[R], by adding the \[ga]+ /*\[ga] line.
.IP \[bu] 2
This is an Include-style filters file, therefore it ends with \[ga]-
**\[ga] which excludes everything not explicitly included.

Note also that Windows implements several \[dq]library\[dq] links such
as \f[C]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]MyLogin\[rs]My Documents\[rs]My Music\f[R]
pointing to \f[C]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]MyLogin\[rs]Music\f[R].
rclone sees these as links, so you must add \f[C]--links\f[R] to the
bisync command line if you which to follow these links.
I find that I get permission errors in trying to follow the links, so I
don\[aq]t include the rclone \f[C]--links\f[R] flag, but then you get
lots of \f[C]Can\[aq]t follow symlink\&...\f[R] noise from rclone about
not following the links.
This noise can be quashed by adding \f[C]--quiet\f[R] to the bisync
command line.
.SS Example exclude-style filters files for use with Dropbox
.IP \[bu] 2
Dropbox disallows synching the listed temporary and configuration/data
files.
The \[ga]- \[ga] filters exclude these files where ever they may occur
in the sync tree.
Consider adding similar exclusions for file types you don\[aq]t need to
sync, such as core dump and software build files.
.IP \[bu] 2
bisync testing creates \f[C]/testdir/\f[R] at the top level of the sync
tree, and usually deletes the tree after the test.
If a normal sync should run while the \f[C]/testdir/\f[R] tree exists
the \f[C]--check-access\f[R] phase may fail due to unbalanced
RCLONE_TEST files.
The \[ga]- /testdir/\[ga] filter blocks this tree from being synched.
You don\[aq]t need this exclusion if you are not doing bisync
development testing.
.IP \[bu] 2
Everything else beneath the Path1/Path2 root will be synched.
.IP \[bu] 2
RCLONE_TEST files may be placed anywhere within the tree, including the
root.

.SS How --check-access handles filters
.PP
At the start of a bisync run, listings are gathered for Path1 and Path2
while using the user\[aq]s \f[C]--filters-file\f[R].
During the check access phase, bisync scans these listings for
\f[C]RCLONE_TEST\f[R] files.
Any \f[C]RCLONE_TEST\f[R] files hidden by the \f[C]--filters-file\f[R]
are \f[I]not\f[R] in the listings and thus not checked during the check
access phase.

.SS Dry run oddity
.PP
The \f[C]--dry-run\f[R] messages may indicate that it would try to
delete some files.
For example, if a file is new on Path2 and does not exist on Path1 then
it would normally be copied to Path1, but with \f[C]--dry-run\f[R]
enabled those copies don\[aq]t happen, which leads to the attempted
delete on the Path2, blocked again by --dry-run:
\f[C]... Not deleting as --dry-run\f[R].
.PP
This whole confusing situation is an artifact of the \f[C]--dry-run\f[R]
flag.
Scrutinize the proposed deletes carefully, and if the files would have
been copied to Path1 then the threatened deletes on Path2 may be
disregarded.
.SS Retries
.PP
Rclone has built in retries.
If you run with \f[C]--verbose\f[R] you\[aq]ll see error and retry
messages such as shown below.
This is usually not a bug.
If at the end of the run you see \f[C]Bisync successful\f[R] and not
\f[C]Bisync critical error\f[R] or \f[C]Bisync aborted\f[R] then the run
was successful, and you can ignore the error messages.
.PP
The following run shows an intermittent fail.
Lines \f[I]5\f[R] and _6- are low level messages.
Line \f[I]6\f[R] is a bubbled-up \f[I]warning\f[R] message, conveying
the error.
Rclone normally retries failing commands, so there may be numerous such
messages in the log.
.PP
Since there are no final error/warning messages on line \f[I]7\f[R],
rclone has recovered from failure after a retry, and the overall sync
was successful.

.SS Testing
.PP
You should read this section only if you are developing for rclone.
You need to have rclone source code locally to work with bisync tests.
.PP
Bisync has a dedicated test framework implemented in the
\f[C]bisync_test.go\f[R] file located in the rclone source tree.
The test suite is based on the \f[C]go test\f[R] command.
Series of tests are stored in subdirectories below the
\f[C]cmd/bisync/testdata\f[R] directory.
Individual tests can be invoked by their directory name, e.g.
\f[C]go test . -case basic -remote local -remote2 gdrive: -v\f[R]
.PP
Tests will make a temporary folder on remote and purge it afterwards.
If during test run there are intermittent errors and rclone retries,
these errors will be captured and flagged as invalid MISCOMPAREs.
Rerunning the test will let it pass.
Consider such failures as noise.

\f[C]path1\f[R] and/or \f[C]path2\f[R] subdirectories are created in a
temporary directory under the respective local or cloud test remote.
.IP \[bu] 2
By default, the Path1 and Path2 test dirs and workdir will be deleted
after each test run.
The \f[C]-no-cleanup\f[R] flag disables purging these directories when
validating and debugging a given test.
These directories will be flushed before running another test,
independent of the \f[C]-no-cleanup\f[R] usage.
.IP \[bu] 2
You will likely want to add \[ga]-
/testdir/\f[C]to your normal   bisync\f[R]--filters-file\f[C]so that normal syncs do not attempt to sync   the test temporary directories, which may have\f[R]RCLONE_TEST\f[C]miscompares   in some testcases which would otherwise trip the\f[R]--check-access\f[C]system.   The\f[R]--check-access\f[C]mechanism is hard-coded to ignore\f[R]RCLONE_TEST\f[C]files beneath\f[R]bisync/testdata\[ga],
so the test cases may reside on the synched tree even if there are check
file mismatches in the test tree.
.IP \[bu] 2
Some Dropbox tests can fail, notably printing the following message:
\f[C]src and dst identical but can\[aq]t set mod time without deleting and re-uploading\f[R]
This is expected and happens due a way Dropbox handles modificaion
times.
You should use the \f[C]-refresh-times\f[R] test flag to make up for
this.
.IP \[bu] 2
If Dropbox tests hit request limit for you and print error message
\f[C]too_many_requests/...: Too many requests or write operations.\f[R]
then follow the Dropbox App ID
instructions (https://rclone.org/dropbox/#get-your-own-dropbox-app-id).
.SS Updating golden results
.PP
Sometimes even a slight change in the bisync source can cause little
changes spread around many log files.
Updating them manually would be a nighmare.
.PP
The \f[C]-golden\f[R] flag will store the \f[C]test.log\f[R] and
\f[C]*.lst\f[R] listings from each test case into respective golden
directories.
Golden results will automatically contain generic strings instead of
local or cloud paths which means that they should match when run with a
different cloud service.
.PP
Your normal workflow might be as follows: 1.
Git-clone the rclone sources locally 2.
Modify bisync source and check that it builds 3.
Run the whole test suite \f[C]go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local\f[R] 4.
If some tests show log difference, recheck them individually, e.g.:
\f[C]go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -case basic\f[R] 5.
If you are convinced with the difference, goldenize all tests at once:
\f[C]go test ./cmd/bisync -remote local -golden\f[R] 6.
Use word diff: \f[C]git diff --word-diff ./cmd/bisync/testdata/\f[R].
Please note that normal line-level diff is generally useless here.
7.
Check the difference \f[I]carefully\f[R]! 8.
Commit the change (\f[C]git commit\f[R]) \f[I]only\f[R] if you are sure.
If unsure, save your code changes then wipe the log diffs from git:
\f[C]git reset [--hard]\f[R].
.SS Structure of test scenarios
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]<testname>/initial/\f[R] contains a tree of files that will be set
as the initial condition on both Path1 and Path2 testdirs.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]<testname>/modfiles/\f[R] contains files that will be used to
modify the Path1 and/or Path2 filesystems.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]<testname>/golden/\f[R] contains the expected content of the test
working directory (\f[C]workdir\f[R]) at the completion of the testcase.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]<testname>/scenario.txt\f[R] contains the body of the test, in the
form of various commands to modify files, run bisync, and snapshot
listings.
Output from these commands is captured to \f[C].../workdir/test.log\f[R]
for comparison to the golden files.
.SS Supported test commands
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]test <some message>\f[R] Print the line to the console and to the
\f[C]test.log\f[R]:
\f[C]test sync is working correctly with options x, y, z\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]copy-listings <prefix>\f[R] Save a copy of all \f[C].lst\f[R]
listings in the test working directory with the specified prefix:
\f[C]save-listings exclude-pass-run\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]move-listings <prefix>\f[R] Similar to \f[C]copy-listings\f[R] but
removes the source
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]purge-children <dir>\f[R] This will delete all child files and
purge all child subdirs under given directory but keep the parent
intact.
This behavior is important for tests with Google Drive because removing
and re-creating the parent would change its ID.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]delete-file <file>\f[R] Delete a single file.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]delete-glob <dir> <pattern>\f[R] Delete a group of files located
one level deep in the given directory with names maching a given glob
pattern.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]touch-glob YYYY-MM-DD <dir> <pattern>\f[R] Change modification time
on a group of files.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]touch-copy YYYY-MM-DD <source-file> <dest-dir>\f[R] Change file
modification time then copy it to destination.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]copy-file <source-file> <dest-dir>\f[R] Copy a single file to given
directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]copy-as <source-file> <dest-file>\f[R] Similar to above but
destination must include both directory and the new file name at
destination.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]copy-dir <src> <dst>\f[R] and \f[C]sync-dir <src> <dst>\f[R]
Copy/sync a directory.
Equivalent of \f[C]rclone copy\f[R] and \f[C]rclone sync\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]list-dirs <dir>\f[R] Equivalent to
\f[C]rclone lsf -R --dirs-only <dir>\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]bisync [options]\f[R] Runs bisync against \f[C]-remote\f[R] and
\f[C]-remote2\f[R].
.SS Supported substitution terms
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]{testdir/}\f[R] - the root dir of the testcase
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]{datadir/}\f[R] - the \f[C]modfiles\f[R] dir under the testcase
root
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]{workdir/}\f[R] - the temporary test working directory
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]{path1/}\f[R] - the root of the Path1 test directory tree

\f[C]{/}\f[R] - OS-specific path separator
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]{spc}\f[R], \f[C]{tab}\f[R], \f[C]{eol}\f[R] - whitespace
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]{chr:HH}\f[R] - raw byte with given hexadecimal code
.PP
Substitution results of the terms named like \f[C]{dir/}\f[R] will end
with \f[C]/\f[R] (or backslash on Windows), so it is not necessary to
include slash in the usage, for example
\f[C]delete-file {path1/}file1.txt\f[R].

This next data is from a user\[aq]s application.
They had \[ti]400GB of data over 1.96 million files being sync\[aq]ed
between a Windows local disk and some remote cloud.
The file full path length was on average 35 characters (which factors
into load time and RAM required).
.IP \[bu] 2
Loading the prior listing into memory (1.96 million files, listing file
size 140 MB) took \[ti]30 sec and occupied about 1 GB of RAM.
.IP \[bu] 2
Getting a fresh listing of the local file system (producing the 140 MB
output file) took about XXX sec.
.IP \[bu] 2
Getting a fresh listing of the remote file system (producing the 140 MB
output file) took about XXX sec.
The network download speed was measured at XXX Mb/s.
.IP \[bu] 2
Once the prior and current Path1 and Path2 listings were loaded (a total
of four to be loaded, two at a time), determining the deltas was pretty
quick (a few seconds for this test case), and the transfer time for any
files to be copied was dominated by the network bandwidth.

.PP
\f[C]rclone about\f[R] is not supported by the 1Fichier backend.
Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount or use policy \f[C]mfs\f[R] (most free space) as a member
of an rclone union remote.
.PP
See List of backends that do not support rclone
about (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) See rclone
about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
.SH Alias
.PP
The \f[C]alias\f[R] remote provides a new name for another remote.
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, e.g.
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R] or
\f[C]/directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
During the initial setup with \f[C]rclone config\f[R] you will specify
the target remote.
The target remote can either be a local path or another remote.
.PP
Subfolders can be used in target remote.
Assume an alias remote named \f[C]backup\f[R] with the target
\f[C]mydrive:private/backup\f[R].
Invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir backup:desktop\f[R] is exactly the same as
invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop\f[R].
.PP
There will be no special handling of paths containing \f[C]..\f[R]
segments.
Invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir backup:../desktop\f[R] is exactly the same as
invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop\f[R].
The empty path is not allowed as a remote.
To alias the current directory use \f[C].\f[R] instead.

.SH Amazon Drive
.PP
Amazon Drive, formerly known as Amazon Cloud Drive, is a cloud storage
service run by Amazon for consumers.
.SS Status
.PP
\f[B]Important:\f[R] rclone supports Amazon Drive only if you have your
own set of API keys.
Unfortunately the Amazon Drive developer
program (https://developer.amazon.com/amazon-drive) is now closed to new
entries so if you don\[aq]t already have your own set of keys you will
not be able to use rclone with Amazon Drive.
.PP
For the history on why rclone no longer has a set of Amazon Drive API
keys see the
forum (https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-has-been-banned-from-amazon-drive/2314).
.PP
If you happen to know anyone who works at Amazon then please ask them to
re-instate rclone into the Amazon Drive developer program - thanks!
.SS Configuration
.PP
The initial setup for Amazon Drive involves getting a token from Amazon
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
The configuration process for Amazon Drive may involve using an oauth
proxy (https://github.com/ncw/oauthproxy).
This is used to keep the Amazon credentials out of the source code.
The proxy runs in Google\[aq]s very secure App Engine environment and
doesn\[aq]t store any credentials which pass through it.
.PP
Since rclone doesn\[aq]t currently have its own Amazon Drive credentials
so you will either need to have your own \f[C]client_id\f[R] and
\f[C]client_secret\f[R] with Amazon Drive, or use a third-party oauth
proxy in which case you will need to enter \f[C]client_id\f[R],
\f[C]client_secret\f[R], \f[C]auth_url\f[R] and \f[C]token_url\f[R].
.PP
Note also if you are not using Amazon\[aq]s \f[C]auth_url\f[R] and
\f[C]token_url\f[R], (ie you filled in something for those) then if
setting up on a remote machine you can only use the copying the config
method of
configuration (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/#configuring-by-copying-the-config-file)
- \f[C]rclone authorize\f[R] will not work.

See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Amazon.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your Amazon Drive
.IP

.SS Modified time and MD5SUMs
.PP
Amazon Drive doesn\[aq]t allow modification times to be changed via the

be used in JSON strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Amazon don\[aq]t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Amazon\[aq]s
apps or via the Amazon Drive website.
As of November 17, 2016, files are automatically deleted by Amazon from
the trash after 30 days.
.SS Using with non \f[C].com\f[R] Amazon accounts
.PP
Let\[aq]s say you usually use \f[C]amazon.co.uk\f[R].
When you authenticate with rclone it will take you to an
\f[C]amazon.com\f[R] page to log in.
Your \f[C]amazon.co.uk\f[R] email and password should work here just
fine.

.SS --acd-upload-wait-per-gb
.PP
Additional time per GiB to wait after a failed complete upload to see if
it appears.
.PP
Sometimes Amazon Drive gives an error when a file has been fully
uploaded but the file appears anyway after a little while.
This happens sometimes for files over 1 GiB in size and nearly every
time for files bigger than 10 GiB.
This parameter controls the time rclone waits for the file to appear.
.PP
The default value for this parameter is 3 minutes per GiB, so by default
it will wait 3 minutes for every GiB uploaded to see if the file
appears.
.PP
You can disable this feature by setting it to 0.
This may cause conflict errors as rclone retries the failed upload but
the file will most likely appear correctly eventually.
.PP
These values were determined empirically by observing lots of uploads of
big files for a range of file sizes.

.SS --acd-templink-threshold
.PP
Files >= this size will be downloaded via their tempLink.
.PP
Files this size or more will be downloaded via their \[dq]tempLink\[dq].
This is to work around a problem with Amazon Drive which blocks
downloads of files bigger than about 10 GiB.
The default for this is 9 GiB which shouldn\[aq]t need to be changed.
.PP
To download files above this threshold, rclone requests a
\[dq]tempLink\[dq] which downloads the file through a temporary URL
directly from the underlying S3 storage.

.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Amazon Drive is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file
called \[dq]Hello.doc\[dq] and one called \[dq]hello.doc\[dq].
.PP
Amazon Drive has rate limiting so you may notice errors in the sync (429
errors).
rclone will automatically retry the sync up to 3 times by default (see
\f[C]--retries\f[R] flag) which should hopefully work around this
problem.
.PP
Amazon Drive has an internal limit of file sizes that can be uploaded to
the service.
This limit is not officially published, but all files larger than this
will fail.
.PP
At the time of writing (Jan 2016) is in the area of 50 GiB per file.
This means that larger files are likely to fail.
.PP
Unfortunately there is no way for rclone to see that this failure is
because of file size, so it will retry the operation, as any other
failure.
To avoid this problem, use \f[C]--max-size 50000M\f[R] option to limit
the maximum size of uploaded files.
Note that \f[C]--max-size\f[R] does not split files into segments, it
only ignores files over this size.
.PP
\f[C]rclone about\f[R] is not supported by the Amazon Drive backend.
Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount or use policy \f[C]mfs\f[R] (most free space) as a member
of an rclone union remote.
.PP

about (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) See rclone

.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X-Amz-Meta-Mtime\f[R] as floating point since the epoch, accurate
to 1 ns.
.PP
If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to
perform a server side copy to update the modification if the object can
be copied in a single part.
In the case the object is larger than 5Gb or is in Glacier or Glacier
Deep Archive storage the object will be uploaded rather than copied.
.PP
Note that reading this from the object takes an additional
\f[C]HEAD\f[R] request as the metadata isn\[aq]t returned in object
listings.
.SS Reducing costs
.SS Avoiding HEAD requests to read the modification time
.PP
By default, rclone will use the modification time of objects stored in
S3 for syncing.
This is stored in object metadata which unfortunately takes an extra
HEAD request to read which can be expensive (in time and money).
.PP
The modification time is used by default for all operations that require
checking the time a file was last updated.
It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it
is inefficient on S3 because it requires an extra API call to retrieve
the metadata.
.PP
The extra API calls can be avoided when syncing (using
\f[C]rclone sync\f[R] or \f[C]rclone copy\f[R]) in a few different ways,
each with its own tradeoffs.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--size-only\f[R]
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Only checks the size of files.
.IP \[bu] 2
Uses no extra transactions.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the file doesn\[aq]t change size then rclone won\[aq]t detect it has
changed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone sync --size-only /path/to/source s3:bucket\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--checksum\f[R]
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Checks the size and MD5 checksum of files.
.IP \[bu] 2
Uses no extra transactions.
.IP \[bu] 2
The most accurate detection of changes possible.
.IP \[bu] 2
Will cause the source to read an MD5 checksum which, if it is a local
disk, will cause lots of disk activity.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the source and destination are both S3 this is the
\f[B]recommended\f[R] flag to use for maximum efficiency.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone sync --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--update --use-server-modtime\f[R]
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Uses no extra transactions.
.IP \[bu] 2
Modification time becomes the time the object was uploaded.
.IP \[bu] 2
For many operations this is sufficient to determine if it needs
uploading.
.IP \[bu] 2
Using \f[C]--update\f[R] along with \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R],
avoids the extra API call and uploads files whose local modification
time is newer than the time it was last uploaded.
.IP \[bu] 2
Files created with timestamps in the past will be missed by the sync.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone sync --update --use-server-modtime /path/to/source s3:bucket\f[R]
.RE
.PP
These flags can and should be used in combination with
\f[C]--fast-list\f[R] - see below.
.PP
If using \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] or any command using the VFS (eg
\f[C]rclone serve\f[R]) commands then you might want to consider using
the VFS flag \f[C]--no-modtime\f[R] which will stop rclone reading the
modification time for every object.
You could also use \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R] if you are happy with
the modification times of the objects being the time of upload.
.SS Avoiding GET requests to read directory listings
.PP
Rclone\[aq]s default directory traversal is to process each directory
individually.
This takes one API call per directory.
Using the \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] flag will read all info about the the
objects into memory first using a smaller number of API calls (one per
1000 objects).
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync --fast-list --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]--fast-list\f[R] trades off API transactions for memory use.
As a rough guide rclone uses 1k of memory per object stored, so using
\f[C]--fast-list\f[R] on a sync of a million objects will use roughly 1
GiB of RAM.
.PP
If you are only copying a small number of files into a big repository
then using \f[C]--no-traverse\f[R] is a good idea.
This finds objects directly instead of through directory listings.
You can do a \[dq]top-up\[dq] sync very cheaply by using
\f[C]--max-age\f[R] and \f[C]--no-traverse\f[R] to copy only recent
files, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/source s3:bucket
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You\[aq]d then do a full \f[C]rclone sync\f[R] less often.
.PP
Note that \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] isn\[aq]t required in the top-up sync.
.SS Avoiding HEAD requests after PUT
.PP
By default, rclone will HEAD every object it uploads.
It does this to check the object got uploaded correctly.
.PP
You can disable this with the --s3-no-head option - see there for more
details.
.PP
Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures.
.SS Hashes
.PP
For small objects which weren\[aq]t uploaded as multipart uploads
(objects sized below \f[C]--s3-upload-cutoff\f[R] if uploaded with
rclone) rclone uses the \f[C]ETag:\f[R] header as an MD5 checksum.
.PP
However for objects which were uploaded as multipart uploads or with
server side encryption (SSE-AWS or SSE-C) the \f[C]ETag\f[R] header is
no longer the MD5 sum of the data, so rclone adds an additional piece of
metadata \f[C]X-Amz-Meta-Md5chksum\f[R] which is a base64 encoded MD5
hash (in the same format as is required for \f[C]Content-MD5\f[R]).
.PP
For large objects, calculating this hash can take some time so the
addition of this hash can be disabled with
\f[C]--s3-disable-checksum\f[R].
This will mean that these objects do not have an MD5 checksum.
.PP
Note that reading this from the object takes an additional
\f[C]HEAD\f[R] request as the metadata isn\[aq]t returned in object
listings.
.SS Cleanup
.PP
If you run \f[C]rclone cleanup s3:bucket\f[R] then it will remove all
pending multipart uploads older than 24 hours.
You can use the \f[C]-i\f[R] flag to see exactly what it will do.
If you want more control over the expiry date then run
\f[C]rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket -o max-age=1h\f[R] to expire all
uploads older than one hour.
You can use \f[C]rclone backend list-multipart-uploads s3:bucket\f[R] to
see the pending multipart uploads.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
S3 allows any valid UTF-8 string as a key.
.PP
Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be used in XML.
.PP
The following characters are replaced since these are problematic when
dealing with the REST API:

.SS Multipart uploads
.PP
rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can upload
files bigger than 5 GiB.
.PP
Note that files uploaded \f[I]both\f[R] with multipart upload
\f[I]and\f[R] through crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.
.PP
rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by \f[C]--s3-upload-cutoff\f[R].
This can be a maximum of 5 GiB and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload
multipart files).
.PP
The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
\f[C]--s3-chunk-size\f[R] and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently
is specified by \f[C]--s3-upload-concurrency\f[R].
.PP
Multipart uploads will use \f[C]--transfers\f[R] *
\f[C]--s3-upload-concurrency\f[R] * \f[C]--s3-chunk-size\f[R] extra
memory.
Single part uploads to not use extra memory.
.PP
Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from S3 - the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.
.PP
Increasing \f[C]--s3-upload-concurrency\f[R] will increase throughput (8
would be a sensible value) and increasing \f[C]--s3-chunk-size\f[R] also
increases throughput (16M would be sensible).
Increasing either of these will use more memory.
The default values are high enough to gain most of the possible
performance without using too much memory.
.SS Buckets and Regions
.PP
With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (\f[C]rclone lsd\f[R]) using any
region, but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region
it was created in.
If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region, you will get an
error,
\f[C]incorrect region, the bucket is not in \[aq]XXX\[aq] region\f[R].
.SS Authentication
.PP
There are a number of ways to supply \f[C]rclone\f[R] with a set of AWS
credentials, with and without using the environment.
.PP
The different authentication methods are tried in this order:
.IP \[bu] 2
Directly in the rclone configuration file (\f[C]env_auth = false\f[R] in
the config file):
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]access_key_id\f[R] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[R] are required.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]session_token\f[R] can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Runtime configuration (\f[C]env_auth = true\f[R] in the config file):
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Export the following environment variables before running
\f[C]rclone\f[R]:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Access Key ID: \f[C]AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\f[R] or \f[C]AWS_ACCESS_KEY\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Secret Access Key: \f[C]AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\f[R] or
\f[C]AWS_SECRET_KEY\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Session Token: \f[C]AWS_SESSION_TOKEN\f[R] (optional)
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Or, use a named
profile (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html):
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools
.IP \[bu] 2
By default it will use the profile in your home directory (e.g.
\f[C]\[ti]/.aws/credentials\f[R] on unix based systems) file and the
\[dq]default\[dq] profile, to change set these environment variables:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE\f[R] to control which file.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]AWS_PROFILE\f[R] to control which profile to use.
.RE
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Or, run \f[C]rclone\f[R] in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).
.IP \[bu] 2
Or, run \f[C]rclone\f[R] on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).
.IP \[bu] 2
Or, run \f[C]rclone\f[R] in an EKS pod with an IAM role that is
associated with a service account (AWS only).
.RE
.PP
If none of these option actually end up providing \f[C]rclone\f[R] with
AWS credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see
below).
.SS S3 Permissions
.PP
When using the \f[C]sync\f[R] subcommand of \f[C]rclone\f[R] the
following minimum permissions are required to be available on the bucket
being written to:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ListBucket\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]DeleteObject\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]GetObject\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]PutObject\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]PutObjectACL\f[R]
.PP
When using the \f[C]lsd\f[R] subcommand, the \f[C]ListAllMyBuckets\f[R]
permission is required.
.PP
Example policy:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]Version\[dq]: \[dq]2012-10-17\[dq],
    \[dq]Statement\[dq]: [
        {

              \[dq]arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME\[dq]
            ]
        },
        {
            \[dq]Effect\[dq]: \[dq]Allow\[dq],
            \[dq]Action\[dq]: \[dq]s3:ListAllMyBuckets\[dq],
            \[dq]Resource\[dq]: \[dq]arn:aws:s3:::*\[dq]
        }
    ]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Notes on above:
.IP "1." 3
This is a policy that can be used when creating bucket.
It assumes that \f[C]USER_NAME\f[R] has been created.
.IP "2." 3
The Resource entry must include both resource ARNs, as one implies the
bucket and the other implies the bucket\[aq]s objects.
.PP
For reference, here\[aq]s an Ansible
script (https://gist.github.com/ebridges/ebfc9042dd7c756cd101cfa807b7ae2b)
that will generate one or more buckets that will work with
\f[C]rclone sync\f[R].
.SS Key Management System (KMS)
.PP
If you are using server-side encryption with KMS then you must make sure
rclone is configured with \f[C]server_side_encryption = aws:kms\f[R]
otherwise you will find you can\[aq]t transfer small objects - these
will create checksum errors.
.SS Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive
.PP
You can upload objects using the glacier storage class or transition
them to glacier using a lifecycle
policy (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html).
The bucket can still be synced or copied into normally, but if rclone
tries to access data from the glacier storage class you will see an
error like below.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
2017/09/11 19:07:43 Failed to sync: failed to open source object: Object in GLACIER, restore first: path/to/file
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this case you need to
restore (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html)
the object(s) in question before using rclone.
.PP
Note that rclone only speaks the S3 API it does not speak the Glacier
Vault API, so rclone cannot directly access Glacier Vaults.
.SS Object-lock enabled S3 bucket
.PP
According to AWS\[aq]s documentation on S3 Object
Lock (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html#object-lock-permission):
.RS
.PP
If you configure a default retention period on a bucket, requests to
upload objects in such a bucket must include the Content-MD5 header.
.RE
.PP
As mentioned in the Hashes section, small files that are not uploaded as
multipart, use a different tag, causing the upload to fail.
A simple solution is to set the \f[C]--s3-upload-cutoff 0\f[R] and force
all the files to be uploaded as multipart.
.SS Standard options

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.
.PP
Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a large
file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.
.PP
Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured chunk_size.
Since the default chunk size is 5 MiB and there can be at most 10,000
chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of a file you can

If this is true (the default) then rclone will use path style access, if
false then rclone will use virtual path style.

.PP
Size of listing chunk (response list for each ListObject S3 request).
.PP
This option is also known as \[dq]MaxKeys\[dq], \[dq]max-items\[dq], or
\[dq]page-size\[dq] from the AWS S3 specification.
Most services truncate the response list to 1000 objects even if
requested more than that.
In AWS S3 this is a global maximum and cannot be changed, see AWS
S3 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html).
In Ceph, this can be increased with the \[dq]rgw list buckets max

.SS --s3-list-version
.PP
Version of ListObjects to use: 1,2 or 0 for auto.
.PP
When S3 originally launched it only provided the ListObjects call to
enumerate objects in a bucket.
.PP
However in May 2016 the ListObjectsV2 call was introduced.
This is much higher performance and should be used if at all possible.
.PP
If set to the default, 0, rclone will guess according to the provider

Whether to url encode listings: true/false/unset
.PP
Some providers support URL encoding listings and where this is available
this is more reliable when using control characters in file names.

.SS --s3-no-check-bucket
.PP
If set, don\[aq]t attempt to check the bucket exists or create it.
.PP
This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.
.PP
It can also be needed if the user you are using does not have bucket
creation permissions.
Before v1.52.0 this would have passed silently due to a bug.

.SS --s3-no-head
.PP
If set, don\[aq]t HEAD uploaded objects to check integrity.
.PP
This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does.
.PP
Setting it means that if rclone receives a 200 OK message after
uploading an object with PUT then it will assume that it got uploaded
properly.
.PP
In particular it will assume:
.IP \[bu] 2
the metadata, including modtime, storage class and content type was as
uploaded
.IP \[bu] 2
the size was as uploaded
.PP
It reads the following items from the response for a single part PUT:
.IP \[bu] 2
the MD5SUM
.IP \[bu] 2
The uploaded date
.PP
For multipart uploads these items aren\[aq]t read.
.PP
If an source object of unknown length is uploaded then rclone
\f[B]will\f[R] do a HEAD request.
.PP
Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures,
in particular an incorrect size, so it isn\[aq]t recommended for normal
operation.
In practice the chance of an undetected upload failure is very small
even with this flag.

.SS Anonymous access to public buckets
.PP
If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank \f[C]access_key_id\f[R] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[R].
Your config should end up looking like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[anons3]
type = s3
provider = AWS
env_auth = false
access_key_id =
secret_access_key =
region = us-east-1
endpoint =
location_constraint =
acl = private
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.
.SS Providers
.SS AWS S3
.PP
This is the provider used as main example and described in the
configuration section above.
.SS AWS Snowball Edge
.PP
AWS Snowball (https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/) is a hardware appliance
used for transferring bulk data back to AWS.
Its main software interface is S3 object storage.
.PP
To use rclone with AWS Snowball Edge devices, configure as standard for
an \[aq]S3 Compatible Service\[aq] be sure to set
\f[C]upload_cutoff = 0\f[R] otherwise you will run into authentication
header issues as the snowball device does not support query parameter
based authentication.
.PP
eg.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[snowball]
type = s3
provider = Other
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
endpoint = http://[IP of Snowball]:8080
upload_cutoff = 0
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Ceph
.PP
Ceph (https://ceph.com/) is an open-source, unified, distributed storage
system designed for excellent performance, reliability and scalability.
It has an S3 compatible object storage interface.
.PP
To use rclone with Ceph, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.
You should end up with something like this in your config:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[ceph]
type = s3
provider = Ceph
env_auth = false
access_key_id = XXX
secret_access_key = YYY
region =
endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.example.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you are using an older version of CEPH, e.g.
10.2.x Jewel, then you may need to supply the parameter
\f[C]--s3-upload-cutoff 0\f[R] or put this in the config file as
\f[C]upload_cutoff 0\f[R] to work around a bug which causes uploading of
small files to fail.
.PP
Note also that Ceph sometimes puts \f[C]/\f[R] in the passwords it gives
users.
If you read the secret access key using the command line tools you will
get a JSON blob with the \f[C]/\f[R] escaped as \f[C]\[rs]/\f[R].
Make sure you only write \f[C]/\f[R] in the secret access key.
.PP
Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]user_id\[dq]: \[dq]xxx\[dq],
    \[dq]display_name\[dq]: \[dq]xxxx\[dq],
    \[dq]keys\[dq]: [
        {
            \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]xxx\[dq],
            \[dq]access_key\[dq]: \[dq]xxxxxx\[dq],
            \[dq]secret_key\[dq]: \[dq]xxxxxx\[rs]/xxxx\[dq]
        }
    ],
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the \f[C]/\f[R] as
\f[C]\[rs]/\f[R], so if you use the secret key as \f[C]xxxxxx/xxxx\f[R]
it will work fine.
.SS Dreamhost
.PP
Dreamhost DreamObjects (https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/) is an
object storage system based on CEPH.
.PP
To use rclone with Dreamhost, configure as above but leave the region
blank and set the endpoint.
You should end up with something like this in your config:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[dreamobjects]
type = s3
provider = DreamHost
env_auth = false
access_key_id = your_access_key
secret_access_key = your_secret_key
region =
endpoint = objects-us-west-1.dream.io
location_constraint =
acl = private
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
\f[R]
.fi
.SS DigitalOcean Spaces
.PP
Spaces (https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/) is an
S3-interoperable (https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/)
object storage service from cloud provider DigitalOcean.
.PP
To connect to DigitalOcean Spaces you will need an access key and secret
key.
These can be retrieved on the \[dq]Applications &
API (https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)\[dq] page of
the DigitalOcean control panel.
They will be needed when prompted by \f[C]rclone config\f[R] for your
\f[C]access_key_id\f[R] and \f[C]secret_access_key\f[R].
.PP
When prompted for a \f[C]region\f[R] or \f[C]location_constraint\f[R],
press enter to use the default value.
The region must be included in the \f[C]endpoint\f[R] setting (e.g.
\f[C]nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\f[R]).
The default values can be used for other settings.
.PP
Going through the whole process of creating a new remote by running
\f[C]rclone config\f[R], each prompt should be answered as shown below:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Storage> s3
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key> YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region>
endpoint> nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint>
acl>
storage_class>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The resulting configuration file should look like:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[spaces]
type = s3
provider = DigitalOcean
env_auth = false
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region =
endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Once configured, you can create a new Space and begin copying files.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mkdir spaces:my-new-space
rclone copy /path/to/files spaces:my-new-space
\f[R]

So you can configure your remote with the
\f[C]storage_class = GLACIER\f[R] option to upload directly to C14.
Don\[aq]t forget that in this state you can\[aq]t read files back after,
you will need to restore them to \[dq]STANDARD\[dq] storage_class first

.SS Backend quirks
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--chunk-size\f[R] is forced to be 64 MiB or greater.
This will use more memory than the default of 5 MiB.
.IP \[bu] 2
Server side copy is disabled as it isn\[aq]t currently supported in the
gateway.
.IP \[bu] 2
GetTier and SetTier are not supported.
.SS Backend bugs
.PP
Due to issue #39 (https://github.com/storj/gateway-mt/issues/39)
uploading multipart files via the S3 gateway causes them to lose their
metadata.
For rclone\[aq]s purpose this means that the modification time is not
stored, nor is any MD5SUM (if one is available from the source).
.PP
This has the following consequences:
.IP \[bu] 2
Using \f[C]rclone rcat\f[R] will fail as the medatada doesn\[aq]t match
after upload
.IP \[bu] 2
Uploading files with \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] will fail for the same
reason
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
This can worked around by using \f[C]--vfs-cache-mode writes\f[R] or
\f[C]--vfs-cache-mode full\f[R] or setting \f[C]--s3-upload-cutoff\f[R]
large
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Files uploaded via a multipart upload won\[aq]t have their modtimes
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
This will mean that \f[C]rclone sync\f[R] will likely keep trying to
upload files bigger than \f[C]--s3-upload-cutoff\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
This can be worked around with \f[C]--checksum\f[R] or
\f[C]--size-only\f[R] or setting \f[C]--s3-upload-cutoff\f[R] large
.IP \[bu] 2
The maximum value for \f[C]--s3-upload-cutoff\f[R] is 5GiB though
.RE
.PP
One general purpose workaround is to set
\f[C]--s3-upload-cutoff 5G\f[R].
This means that rclone will upload files smaller than 5GiB as single
parts.
Note that this can be set in the config file with
\f[C]upload_cutoff = 5G\f[R] or configured in the advanced settings.
If you regularly transfer files larger than 5G then using
\f[C]--checksum\f[R] or \f[C]--size-only\f[R] in \f[C]rclone sync\f[R]
is the recommended workaround.
.SS Comparison with the native protocol
.PP
Use the the native protocol to take advantage of client-side encryption
as well as to achieve the best possible download performance.
Uploads will be erasure-coded locally, thus a 1gb upload will result in
2.68gb of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.
.PP
Use this backend and the S3 compatible Hosted Gateway to increase upload
performance and reduce the load on your systems and network.
Uploads will be encrypted and erasure-coded server-side, thus a 1GB
upload will result in only in 1GB of data being uploaded to storage
nodes across the network.
.PP
For more detailed comparison please check the documentation of the storj
backend.
.SS Limitations
.PP
\f[C]rclone about\f[R] is not supported by the S3 backend.
Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount or use policy \f[C]mfs\f[R] (most free space) as a member
of an rclone union remote.
.PP
See List of backends that do not support rclone
about (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) See rclone
about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
.SH Backblaze B2

.SS Application Keys
.PP
B2 supports multiple Application Keys for different access permission to
B2 Buckets (https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/application_keys.html).
.PP
You can use these with rclone too; you will need to use rclone version
1.43 or later.
.PP
Follow Backblaze\[aq]s docs to create an Application Key with the
required permission and add the \f[C]applicationKeyId\f[R] as the
\f[C]account\f[R] and the \f[C]Application Key\f[R] itself as the
\f[C]key\f[R].
.PP
Note that you must put the \f[I]applicationKeyId\f[R] as the
\f[C]account\f[R] \[en] you can\[aq]t use the master Account ID.
If you try then B2 will return 401 errors.
.SS --fast-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X-Bz-Info-src_last_modified_millis\f[R] as milliseconds since
1970-01-01 in the Backblaze standard.
Other tools should be able to use this as a modified time.
.PP
Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.
Note that if a modification time needs to be updated on an object then
it will create a new version of the object.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l c c.
T{
Character
T}@T{
Value
T}@T{
Replacement
T}
_
T{
\[rs]
T}@T{
0x5C
T}@T{
\[uFF3C]
T}
.TE
.PP
Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.PP
Note that in 2020-05 Backblaze started allowing \ characters in file
names.
Rclone hasn\[aq]t changed its encoding as this could cause syncs to
re-transfer files.
If you want rclone not to replace \ then see the \f[C]--b2-encoding\f[R]
flag below and remove the \f[C]BackSlash\f[R] from the string.
This can be set in the config.
.SS SHA1 checksums
.PP
The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and
will be used in the syncing process.
.PP
Large files (bigger than the limit in \f[C]--b2-upload-cutoff\f[R])
which are uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the object as
\f[C]X-Bz-Info-large_file_sha1\f[R] as recommended by Backblaze.
.PP
For a large file to be uploaded with an SHA1 checksum, the source needs
to support SHA1 checksums.
The local disk supports SHA1 checksums so large file transfers from
local disk will have an SHA1.
See the overview (https://rclone.org/overview/#features) for exactly
which remotes support SHA1.
.PP
Sources which don\[aq]t support SHA1, in particular \f[C]crypt\f[R] will
upload large files without SHA1 checksums.
This may be fixed in the future (see
#1767 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1767)).
.PP
Files sizes below \f[C]--b2-upload-cutoff\f[R] will always have an SHA1
regardless of the source.
.SS Transfers
.PP
Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for
maximum speed.
In tests from my SSD equipped laptop the optimum setting is about
\f[C]--transfers 32\f[R] though higher numbers may be used for a slight
speed improvement.
The optimum number for you may vary depending on your hardware, how big
the files are, how much you want to load your computer, etc.
The default of \f[C]--transfers 4\f[R] is definitely too low for
Backblaze B2 though.
.PP
Note that uploading big files (bigger than 200 MiB by default) will use
a 96 MiB RAM buffer by default.
There can be at most \f[C]--transfers\f[R] of these in use at any
moment, so this sets the upper limit on the memory used.
.SS Versions
.PP
When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of
it (https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/file_versions.html).
Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked hidden
and still be available.
Conversely, you may opt in to a \[dq]hard delete\[dq] of files with the
\f[C]--b2-hard-delete\f[R] flag which would permanently remove the file
instead of hiding it.
.PP
Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the
\f[C]--b2-versions\f[R] flag.
.PP
If you wish to remove all the old versions then you can use the
\f[C]rclone cleanup remote:bucket\f[R] command which will delete all the
old versions of files, leaving the current ones intact.
You can also supply a path and only old versions under that path will be
deleted, e.g.
\f[C]rclone cleanup remote:bucket/path/to/stuff\f[R].
.PP
Note that \f[C]cleanup\f[R] will remove partially uploaded files from
the bucket if they are more than a day old.
.PP
When you \f[C]purge\f[R] a bucket, the current and the old versions will
be deleted then the bucket will be deleted.
.PP
However \f[C]delete\f[R] will cause the current versions of the files to
become hidden old versions.
.PP
Here is a session showing the listing and retrieval of an old version
followed by a \f[C]cleanup\f[R] of the old versions.
.PP
Show current version and all the versions with \f[C]--b2-versions\f[R]
flag.

.SS Data usage
.PP
It is useful to know how many requests are sent to the server in
different scenarios.
.PP
All copy commands send the following 4 requests:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/b2api/v1/b2_authorize_account
/b2api/v1/b2_create_bucket
/b2api/v1/b2_list_buckets
/b2api/v1/b2_list_file_names
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[C]b2_list_file_names\f[R] request will be sent once for every 1k
files in the remote path, providing the checksum and modification time
of the listed files.
As of version 1.33 issue
#818 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/818) causes extra requests
to be sent when using B2 with Crypt.
When a copy operation does not require any files to be uploaded, no more
requests will be sent.
.PP
Uploading files that do not require chunking, will send 2 requests per
file upload:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Uploading files requiring chunking, will send 2 requests (one each to
start and finish the upload) and another 2 requests for each chunk:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/b2api/v1/b2_start_large_file
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_part_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_part/
/b2api/v1/b2_finish_large_file
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Versions
.PP
Versions can be viewed with the \f[C]--b2-versions\f[R] flag.
When it is set rclone will show and act on older versions of files.
For example
.PP
Listing without \f[C]--b2-versions\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

.fi
.PP
And with
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
        8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
       16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
       15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Showing that the current version is unchanged but older versions can be
seen.
These have the UTC date that they were uploaded to the server to the
nearest millisecond appended to them.
.PP
Note that when using \f[C]--b2-versions\f[R] no file write operations
are permitted, so you can\[aq]t upload files or delete them.
.SS B2 and rclone link
.PP
Rclone supports generating file share links for private B2 buckets.
They can either be for a file for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\&./rclone link B2:bucket/path/to/file.txt
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file.txt?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or if run on a directory you will get:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\&./rclone link B2:bucket/path
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
you can then use the authorization token (the part of the url from the
\f[C]?Authorization=\f[R] on) on any file path under that directory.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file1?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/file2?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/folder/file3?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Box.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

.SS Using rclone with an Enterprise account with SSO
.PP
If you have an \[dq]Enterprise\[dq] account type with Box with single
sign on (SSO), you need to create a password to use Box with rclone.
This can be done at your Enterprise Box account by going to Settings,
\[dq]Account\[dq] Tab, and then set the password in the
\[dq]Authentication\[dq] field.
.PP
Once you have done this, you can setup your Enterprise Box account using
the same procedure detailed above in the, using the password you have
just set.
.SS Invalid refresh token
.PP
According to the box
docs (https://developer.box.com/v2.0/docs/oauth-20#section-6-using-the-access-and-refresh-tokens):
.RS
.PP
Each refresh_token is valid for one use in 60 days.

.IP \[bu] 2
Copy the config file with a box refresh token in and use it in two
places
.IP \[bu] 2
Get an error on a token refresh
.PP
then rclone will return an error which includes the text
\f[C]Invalid refresh token\f[R].
.PP
To fix this you will need to use oauth2 again to update the refresh
token.
You can use the methods in the remote setup
docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/), bearing in mind that if you use
the copy the config file method, you should not use that remote on the

.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
Box allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
Box supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the \f[C]--checksum\f[R]
flag.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:

.PP
Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.SS Transfers
.PP
For files above 50 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer.
Rclone will upload up to \f[C]--transfers\f[R] chunks at the same time
(shared among all the multipart uploads).
Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 8 MiB so increasing
\f[C]--transfers\f[R] will increase memory use.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Depending on the enterprise settings for your user, the item will either
be actually deleted from Box or moved to the trash.
.PP
Emptying the trash is supported via the rclone however cleanup command
however this deletes every trashed file and folder individually so it
may take a very long time.
Emptying the trash via the WebUI does not have this limitation so it is
advised to empty the trash via the WebUI.
.SS Root folder ID
.PP
You can set the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] for rclone.
This is the directory (identified by its \f[C]Folder ID\f[R]) that
rclone considers to be the root of your Box drive.
.PP
Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.
.PP
However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.
.PP
In order to do this you will have to find the \f[C]Folder ID\f[R] of the
directory you wish rclone to display.
This will be the last segment of the URL when you open the relevant
folder in the Box web interface.
.PP
So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
\f[C]https://app.box.com/folder/11xxxxxxxxx8\f[R] in the browser, then
you use \f[C]11xxxxxxxxx8\f[R] as the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] in the
config.

.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Box is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file called
\[dq]Hello.doc\[dq] and one called \[dq]hello.doc\[dq].
.PP
Box file names can\[aq]t have the \f[C]\[rs]\f[R] character in.
rclone maps this to and from an identical looking unicode equivalent
\f[C]\[uFF3C]\f[R] (U+FF3C Fullwidth Reverse Solidus).
.PP
Box only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.
.PP
\f[C]rclone about\f[R] is not supported by the Box backend.
Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount or use policy \f[C]mfs\f[R] (most free space) as a member
of an rclone union remote.
.PP
See List of backends that do not support rclone
about (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) See rclone
about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
.SH Cache (DEPRECATED)
.PP
The \f[C]cache\f[R] remote wraps another existing remote and stores file
structure and its data for long running tasks like
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R].
.SS Status
.PP
The cache backend code is working but it currently doesn\[aq]t have a
maintainer so there are outstanding
bugs (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3A%22Remote%3A+Cache%22)
which aren\[aq]t getting fixed.
.PP
The cache backend is due to be phased out in favour of the VFS caching
layer eventually which is more tightly integrated into rclone.
.PP
Until this happens we recommend only using the cache backend if you find
you can\[aq]t work without it.
There are many docs online describing the use of the cache backend to
minimize API hits and by-and-large these are out of date and the cache
backend isn\[aq]t needed in those scenarios any more.
.SS Configuration
.PP
To get started you just need to have an existing remote which can be
configured with \f[C]cache\f[R].
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]test-cache\f[R].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 rclone config
\f[R]

.SS Write Features
.SS Offline uploading
.PP
In an effort to make writing through cache more reliable, the backend
now supports this feature which can be activated by specifying a
\f[C]cache-tmp-upload-path\f[R].
.PP
A files goes through these states when using this feature:
.IP "1." 3
An upload is started (usually by copying a file on the cache remote)
.IP "2." 3
When the copy to the temporary location is complete the file is part of
the cached remote and looks and behaves like any other file (reading
included)
.IP "3." 3
After \f[C]cache-tmp-wait-time\f[R] passes and the file is next in line,
\f[C]rclone move\f[R] is used to move the file to the cloud provider
.IP "4." 3
Reading the file still works during the upload but most modifications on
it will be prohibited
.IP "5." 3
Once the move is complete the file is unlocked for modifications as it
becomes as any other regular file
.IP "6." 3
If the file is being read through \f[C]cache\f[R] when it\[aq]s actually
deleted from the temporary path then \f[C]cache\f[R] will simply swap
the source to the cloud provider without interrupting the reading (small
blip can happen though)
.PP
Files are uploaded in sequence and only one file is uploaded at a time.
Uploads will be stored in a queue and be processed based on the order
they were added.
The queue and the temporary storage is persistent across restarts but
can be cleared on startup with the \f[C]--cache-db-purge\f[R] flag.
.SS Write Support
.PP
Writes are supported through \f[C]cache\f[R].
One caveat is that a mounted cache remote does not add any retry or
fallback mechanism to the upload operation.
This will depend on the implementation of the wrapped remote.
Consider using \f[C]Offline uploading\f[R] for reliable writes.
.PP
One special case is covered with \f[C]cache-writes\f[R] which will cache
the file data at the same time as the upload when it is enabled making
it available from the cache store immediately once the upload is
finished.
.SS Read Features
.SS Multiple connections
.PP
To counter the high latency between a local PC where rclone is running
and cloud providers, the cache remote can split multiple requests to the
cloud provider for smaller file chunks and combines them together
locally where they can be available almost immediately before the reader
usually needs them.
.PP
This is similar to buffering when media files are played online.
Rclone will stay around the current marker but always try its best to
stay ahead and prepare the data before.
.SS Plex Integration
.PP
There is a direct integration with Plex which allows cache to detect
during reading if the file is in playback or not.
This helps cache to adapt how it queries the cloud provider depending on
what is needed for.
.PP
Scans will have a minimum amount of workers (1) while in a confirmed
playback cache will deploy the configured number of workers.
.PP
This integration opens the doorway to additional performance
improvements which will be explored in the near future.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If Plex options are not configured, \f[C]cache\f[R] will
function with its configured options without adapting any of its
settings.
.PP
How to enable?
Run \f[C]rclone config\f[R] and add all the Plex options (endpoint,
username and password) in your remote and it will be automatically
enabled.
.PP
Affected settings: - \f[C]cache-workers\f[R]: \f[I]Configured value\f[R]
during confirmed playback or \f[I]1\f[R] all the other times
.SS Certificate Validation
.PP
When the Plex server is configured to only accept secure connections, it
is possible to use \f[C].plex.direct\f[R] URLs to ensure certificate
validation succeeds.
These URLs are used by Plex internally to connect to the Plex server
securely.
.PP
The format for these URLs is the following:
.PP
\f[C]https://ip-with-dots-replaced.server-hash.plex.direct:32400/\f[R]
.PP
The \f[C]ip-with-dots-replaced\f[R] part can be any IPv4 address, where
the dots have been replaced with dashes, e.g.
\f[C]127.0.0.1\f[R] becomes \f[C]127-0-0-1\f[R].
.PP
To get the \f[C]server-hash\f[R] part, the easiest way is to visit
.PP
https://plex.tv/api/resources?includeHttps=1&X-Plex-Token=your-plex-token
.PP
This page will list all the available Plex servers for your account with
at least one \f[C].plex.direct\f[R] link for each.
Copy one URL and replace the IP address with the desired address.
This can be used as the \f[C]plex_url\f[R] value.
.SS Known issues
.SS Mount and --dir-cache-time
.PP
--dir-cache-time controls the first layer of directory caching which
works at the mount layer.
Being an independent caching mechanism from the \f[C]cache\f[R] backend,
it will manage its own entries based on the configured time.
.PP
To avoid getting in a scenario where dir cache has obsolete data and
cache would have the correct one, try to set \f[C]--dir-cache-time\f[R]
to a lower time than \f[C]--cache-info-age\f[R].
Default values are already configured in this way.
.SS Windows support - Experimental
.PP
There are a couple of issues with Windows \f[C]mount\f[R] functionality
that still require some investigations.
It should be considered as experimental thus far as fixes come in for
this OS.
.PP
Most of the issues seem to be related to the difference between
filesystems on Linux flavors and Windows as cache is heavily dependent
on them.
.PP
Any reports or feedback on how cache behaves on this OS is greatly
appreciated.

.SS Risk of throttling
.PP
Future iterations of the cache backend will make use of the pooling
functionality of the cloud provider to synchronize and at the same time
make writing through it more tolerant to failures.
.PP
There are a couple of enhancements in track to add these but in the
meantime there is a valid concern that the expiring cache listings can
lead to cloud provider throttles or bans due to repeated queries on it
for very large mounts.
.PP
Some recommendations: - don\[aq]t use a very small interval for entry
information (\f[C]--cache-info-age\f[R]) - while writes aren\[aq]t yet
optimised, you can still write through \f[C]cache\f[R] which gives you
the advantage of adding the file in the cache at the same time if
configured to do so.
.PP
Future enhancements:

.SS cache and crypt
.PP
One common scenario is to keep your data encrypted in the cloud provider
using the \f[C]crypt\f[R] remote.
\f[C]crypt\f[R] uses a similar technique to wrap around an existing
remote and handles this translation in a seamless way.
.PP
There is an issue with wrapping the remotes in this order: \f[B]cloud
remote\f[R] -> \f[B]crypt\f[R] -> \f[B]cache\f[R]
.PP
During testing, I experienced a lot of bans with the remotes in this
order.
I suspect it might be related to how crypt opens files on the cloud
provider which makes it think we\[aq]re downloading the full file
instead of small chunks.
Organizing the remotes in this order yields better results: \f[B]cloud
remote\f[R] -> \f[B]cache\f[R] -> \f[B]crypt\f[R]
.SS absolute remote paths
.PP
\f[C]cache\f[R] can not differentiate between relative and absolute
paths for the wrapped remote.
Any path given in the \f[C]remote\f[R] config setting and on the command
line will be passed to the wrapped remote as is, but for storing the
chunks on disk the path will be made relative by removing any leading
\f[C]/\f[R] character.
.PP
This behavior is irrelevant for most backend types, but there are
backends where a leading \f[C]/\f[R] changes the effective directory,
e.g.
in the \f[C]sftp\f[R] backend paths starting with a \f[C]/\f[R] are
relative to the root of the SSH server and paths without are relative to
the user home directory.
As a result \f[C]sftp:bin\f[R] and \f[C]sftp:/bin\f[R] will share the
same cache folder, even if they represent a different directory on the
SSH server.
.SS Cache and Remote Control (--rc)
.PP
Cache supports the new \f[C]--rc\f[R] mode in rclone and can be remote
controlled through the following end points: By default, the listener is
disabled if you do not add the flag.
.SS rc cache/expire
.PP
Purge a remote from the cache backend.
Supports either a directory or a file.
It supports both encrypted and unencrypted file names if cache is
wrapped by crypt.

How many times to retry a read from a cache storage.
.PP
Since reading from a cache stream is independent from downloading file
data, readers can get to a point where there\[aq]s no more data in the
cache.
Most of the times this can indicate a connectivity issue if cache
isn\[aq]t able to provide file data anymore.

.SS --cache-workers
.PP
How many workers should run in parallel to download chunks.
.PP
Higher values will mean more parallel processing (better CPU needed) and
more concurrent requests on the cloud provider.
This impacts several aspects like the cloud provider API limits, more
stress on the hardware that rclone runs on but it also means that
streams will be more fluid and data will be available much more faster
to readers.

.SS --cache-chunk-no-memory
.PP
Disable the in-memory cache for storing chunks during streaming.
.PP
By default, cache will keep file data during streaming in RAM as well to
provide it to readers as fast as possible.
.PP
This transient data is evicted as soon as it is read and the number of
chunks stored doesn\[aq]t exceed the number of workers.
However, depending on other settings like \[dq]cache-chunk-size\[dq] and
\[dq]cache-workers\[dq] this footprint can increase if there are
parallel streams too (multiple files being read at the same time).
.PP
If the hardware permits it, use this feature to provide an overall
better performance during streaming but it can also be disabled if RAM
is not available on the local machine.

This setting places a hard limit on the number of requests per second
that cache will be doing to the cloud provider remote and try to respect
that value by setting waits between reads.
.PP
If you find that you\[aq]re getting banned or limited on the cloud
provider through cache and know that a smaller number of requests per
second will allow you to work with it then you can use this setting for
that.
.PP
A good balance of all the other settings should make this setting
useless but it is available to set for more special cases.

.SH Chunker (BETA)
.PP
The \f[C]chunker\f[R] overlay transparently splits large files into
smaller chunks during upload to wrapped remote and transparently
assembles them back when the file is downloaded.
This allows to effectively overcome size limits imposed by storage
providers.
.SS Configuration
.PP
To use it, first set up the underlying remote following the
configuration instructions for that remote.
You can also use a local pathname instead of a remote.
.PP
First check your chosen remote is working - we\[aq]ll call it
\f[C]remote:path\f[R] here.
Note that anything inside \f[C]remote:path\f[R] will be chunked and
anything outside won\[aq]t.
This means that if you are using a bucket-based remote (e.g.
S3, B2, swift) then you should probably put the bucket in the remote
\f[C]s3:bucket\f[R].
.PP
Now configure \f[C]chunker\f[R] using \f[C]rclone config\f[R].
We will call this one \f[C]overlay\f[R] to separate it from the
\f[C]remote\f[R] itself.

.SS Specifying the remote
.PP
In normal use, make sure the remote has a \f[C]:\f[R] in.
If you specify the remote without a \f[C]:\f[R] then rclone will use a
local directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of \f[C]/path/to/secret/files\f[R] then rclone
will chunk stuff in that directory.
If you use a remote of \f[C]name\f[R] then rclone will put files in a
directory called \f[C]name\f[R] in the current directory.
.SS Chunking
.PP
When rclone starts a file upload, chunker checks the file size.
If it doesn\[aq]t exceed the configured chunk size, chunker will just
pass the file to the wrapped remote.
If a file is large, chunker will transparently cut data in pieces with
temporary names and stream them one by one, on the fly.
Each data chunk will contain the specified number of bytes, except for
the last one which may have less data.
If file size is unknown in advance (this is called a streaming upload),
chunker will internally create a temporary copy, record its size and
repeat the above process.
.PP
When upload completes, temporary chunk files are finally renamed.
This scheme guarantees that operations can be run in parallel and look
from outside as atomic.
A similar method with hidden temporary chunks is used for other
operations (copy/move/rename, etc.).
If an operation fails, hidden chunks are normally destroyed, and the
target composite file stays intact.
.PP
When a composite file download is requested, chunker transparently
assembles it by concatenating data chunks in order.
As the split is trivial one could even manually concatenate data chunks
together to obtain the original content.
.PP
When the \f[C]list\f[R] rclone command scans a directory on wrapped
remote, the potential chunk files are accounted for, grouped and
assembled into composite directory entries.
Any temporary chunks are hidden.
.PP
List and other commands can sometimes come across composite files with
missing or invalid chunks, e.g.
shadowed by like-named directory or another file.
This usually means that wrapped file system has been directly tampered
with or damaged.
If chunker detects a missing chunk it will by default print warning,
skip the whole incomplete group of chunks but proceed with current
command.
You can set the \f[C]--chunker-fail-hard\f[R] flag to have commands
abort with error message in such cases.
.SS Chunk names
.PP
The default chunk name format is \f[C]*.rclone_chunk.###\f[R], hence by
default chunk names are \f[C]BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001\f[R],
\f[C]BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.002\f[R] etc.
You can configure another name format using the \f[C]name_format\f[R]
configuration file option.
The format uses asterisk \f[C]*\f[R] as a placeholder for the base file
name and one or more consecutive hash characters \f[C]#\f[R] as a
placeholder for sequential chunk number.
There must be one and only one asterisk.
The number of consecutive hash characters defines the minimum length of
a string representing a chunk number.
If decimal chunk number has less digits than the number of hashes, it is
left-padded by zeros.
If the decimal string is longer, it is left intact.
By default numbering starts from 1 but there is another option that
allows user to start from 0, e.g.
for compatibility with legacy software.
.PP
For example, if name format is \f[C]big_*-##.part\f[R] and original file
name is \f[C]data.txt\f[R] and numbering starts from 0, then the first
chunk will be named \f[C]big_data.txt-00.part\f[R], the 99th chunk will
be \f[C]big_data.txt-98.part\f[R] and the 302nd chunk will become
\f[C]big_data.txt-301.part\f[R].
.PP
Note that \f[C]list\f[R] assembles composite directory entries only when
chunk names match the configured format and treats non-conforming file
names as normal non-chunked files.
.PP
When using \f[C]norename\f[R] transactions, chunk names will
additionally have a unique file version suffix.
For example, \f[C]BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001_bp562k\f[R].
.SS Metadata
.PP
Besides data chunks chunker will by default create metadata object for a
composite file.
The object is named after the original file.
Chunker allows user to disable metadata completely (the \f[C]none\f[R]
format).
Note that metadata is normally not created for files smaller than the
configured chunk size.
This may change in future rclone releases.
.SS Simple JSON metadata format
.PP
This is the default format.
It supports hash sums and chunk validation for composite files.
Meta objects carry the following fields:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ver\f[R] - version of format, currently \f[C]1\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]size\f[R] - total size of composite file
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]nchunks\f[R] - number of data chunks in file
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]md5\f[R] - MD5 hashsum of composite file (if present)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]sha1\f[R] - SHA1 hashsum (if present)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]txn\f[R] - identifies current version of the file
.PP
There is no field for composite file name as it\[aq]s simply equal to
the name of meta object on the wrapped remote.
Please refer to respective sections for details on hashsums and modified
time handling.
.SS No metadata
.PP
You can disable meta objects by setting the meta format option to
\f[C]none\f[R].
In this mode chunker will scan directory for all files that follow
configured chunk name format, group them by detecting chunks with the
same base name and show group names as virtual composite files.
This method is more prone to missing chunk errors (especially missing
last chunk) than format with metadata enabled.
.SS Hashsums
.PP
Chunker supports hashsums only when a compatible metadata is present.
Hence, if you choose metadata format of \f[C]none\f[R], chunker will
report hashsum as \f[C]UNSUPPORTED\f[R].
.PP
Please note that by default metadata is stored only for composite files.
If a file is smaller than configured chunk size, chunker will
transparently redirect hash requests to wrapped remote, so support
depends on that.
You will see the empty string as a hashsum of requested type for small
files if the wrapped remote doesn\[aq]t support it.
.PP
Many storage backends support MD5 and SHA1 hash types, so does chunker.
With chunker you can choose one or another but not both.
MD5 is set by default as the most supported type.
Since chunker keeps hashes for composite files and falls back to the
wrapped remote hash for non-chunked ones, we advise you to choose the
same hash type as supported by wrapped remote so that your file listings
look coherent.
.PP
If your storage backend does not support MD5 or SHA1 but you need
consistent file hashing, configure chunker with \f[C]md5all\f[R] or
\f[C]sha1all\f[R].
These two modes guarantee given hash for all files.
If wrapped remote doesn\[aq]t support it, chunker will then add metadata
to all files, even small.
However, this can double the amount of small files in storage and incur
additional service charges.
You can even use chunker to force md5/sha1 support in any other remote
at expense of sidecar meta objects by setting e.g.
\f[C]chunk_type=sha1all\f[R] to force hashsums and
\f[C]chunk_size=1P\f[R] to effectively disable chunking.
.PP
Normally, when a file is copied to chunker controlled remote, chunker
will ask the file source for compatible file hash and revert to
on-the-fly calculation if none is found.
This involves some CPU overhead but provides a guarantee that given
hashsum is available.
Also, chunker will reject a server-side copy or move operation if source
and destination hashsum types are different resulting in the extra
network bandwidth, too.
In some rare cases this may be undesired, so chunker provides two
optional choices: \f[C]sha1quick\f[R] and \f[C]md5quick\f[R].
If the source does not support primary hash type and the quick mode is
enabled, chunker will try to fall back to the secondary type.
This will save CPU and bandwidth but can result in empty hashsums at
destination.
Beware of consequences: the \f[C]sync\f[R] command will revert
(sometimes silently) to time/size comparison if compatible hashsums
between source and target are not found.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Chunker stores modification times using the wrapped remote so support
depends on that.
For a small non-chunked file the chunker overlay simply manipulates
modification time of the wrapped remote file.
For a composite file with metadata chunker will get and set modification
time of the metadata object on the wrapped remote.
If file is chunked but metadata format is \f[C]none\f[R] then chunker
will use modification time of the first data chunk.
.SS Migrations
.PP
The idiomatic way to migrate to a different chunk size, hash type,
transaction style or chunk naming scheme is to:
.IP \[bu] 2
Collect all your chunked files under a directory and have your chunker
remote point to it.
.IP \[bu] 2
Create another directory (most probably on the same cloud storage) and
configure a new remote with desired metadata format, hash type, chunk
naming etc.
.IP \[bu] 2
Now run \f[C]rclone sync -i oldchunks: newchunks:\f[R] and all your data
will be transparently converted in transfer.
This may take some time, yet chunker will try server-side copy if
possible.
.IP \[bu] 2
After checking data integrity you may remove configuration section of
the old remote.
.PP
If rclone gets killed during a long operation on a big composite file,
hidden temporary chunks may stay in the directory.
They will not be shown by the \f[C]list\f[R] command but will eat up
your account quota.
Please note that the \f[C]deletefile\f[R] command deletes only active
chunks of a file.
As a workaround, you can use remote of the wrapped file system to see
them.
An easy way to get rid of hidden garbage is to copy littered directory
somewhere using the chunker remote and purge the original directory.
The \f[C]copy\f[R] command will copy only active chunks while the
\f[C]purge\f[R] will remove everything including garbage.
.SS Caveats and Limitations
.PP
Chunker requires wrapped remote to support server-side \f[C]move\f[R]
(or \f[C]copy\f[R] + \f[C]delete\f[R]) operations, otherwise it will
explicitly refuse to start.
This is because it internally renames temporary chunk files to their
final names when an operation completes successfully.
.PP
Chunker encodes chunk number in file name, so with default
\f[C]name_format\f[R] setting it adds 17 characters.
Also chunker adds 7 characters of temporary suffix during operations.
Many file systems limit base file name without path by 255 characters.
Using rclone\[aq]s crypt remote as a base file system limits file name
by 143 characters.
Thus, maximum name length is 231 for most files and 119 for
chunker-over-crypt.
A user in need can change name format to e.g.
\f[C]*.rcc##\f[R] and save 10 characters (provided at most 99 chunks per
file).
.PP
Note that a move implemented using the copy-and-delete method may incur
double charging with some cloud storage providers.
.PP
Chunker will not automatically rename existing chunks when you run
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] on a live remote and change the chunk name
format.
Beware that in result of this some files which have been treated as
chunks before the change can pop up in directory listings as normal
files and vice versa.
The same warning holds for the chunk size.
If you desperately need to change critical chunking settings, you should
run data migration as described above.
.PP
If wrapped remote is case insensitive, the chunker overlay will inherit
that property (so you can\[aq]t have a file called \[dq]Hello.doc\[dq]
and \[dq]hello.doc\[dq] in the same directory).
.PP
Chunker included in rclone releases up to \f[C]v1.54\f[R] can sometimes
fail to detect metadata produced by recent versions of rclone.
We recommend users to keep rclone up-to-date to avoid data corruption.
.PP
Changing \f[C]transactions\f[R] is dangerous and requires explicit
migration.

See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Citrix ShareFile.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP

.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
ShareFile allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
ShareFile supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the
\f[C]--checksum\f[R] flag.
.SS Transfers
.PP
For files above 128 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer.
Rclone will upload up to \f[C]--transfers\f[R] chunks at the same time
(shared among all the multipart uploads).
Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 64 MiB so increasing
\f[C]--transfers\f[R] will increase memory use.

.PP
See List of backends that do not support rclone
about (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) See rclone
about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
.SH Crypt
.PP
Rclone \f[C]crypt\f[R] remotes encrypt and decrypt other remotes.
.PP
A remote of type \f[C]crypt\f[R] does not access a storage
system (https://rclone.org/overview/) directly, but instead wraps
another remote, which in turn accesses the storage system.
This is similar to how alias (https://rclone.org/alias/),
union (https://rclone.org/union/), chunker (https://rclone.org/chunker/)
and a few others work.
It makes the usage very flexible, as you can add a layer, in this case
an encryption layer, on top of any other backend, even in multiple
layers.
Rclone\[aq]s functionality can be used as with any other remote, for
example you can mount (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) a
crypt remote.
.PP
Accessing a storage system through a crypt remote realizes client-side
encryption, which makes it safe to keep your data in a location you do
not trust will not get compromised.
When working against the \f[C]crypt\f[R] remote, rclone will
automatically encrypt (before uploading) and decrypt (after downloading)
on your local system as needed on the fly, leaving the data encrypted at
rest in the wrapped remote.
If you access the storage system using an application other than rclone,
or access the wrapped remote directly using rclone, there will not be
any encryption/decryption: Downloading existing content will just give
you the encrypted (scrambled) format, and anything you upload will
\f[I]not\f[R] become encrypted.
.PP
The encryption is a secret-key encryption (also called symmetric key
encryption) algorithm, where a password (or pass phrase) is used to
generate real encryption key.
The password can be supplied by user, or you may chose to let rclone
generate one.
It will be stored in the configuration file, in a lightly obscured form.
If you are in an environment where you are not able to keep your
configuration secured, you should add configuration
encryption (https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption) as
protection.
As long as you have this configuration file, you will be able to decrypt
your data.
Without the configuration file, as long as you remember the password (or
keep it in a safe place), you can re-create the configuration and gain
access to the existing data.
You may also configure a corresponding remote in a different
installation to access the same data.
See below for guidance to changing password.
.PP
Encryption uses cryptographic
salt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)), to permute the
encryption key so that the same string may be encrypted in different
ways.
When configuring the crypt remote it is optional to enter a salt, or to
let rclone generate a unique salt.
If omitted, rclone uses a built-in unique string.
Normally in cryptography, the salt is stored together with the encrypted
content, and do not have to be memorized by the user.
This is not the case in rclone, because rclone does not store any
additional information on the remotes.
Use of custom salt is effectively a second password that must be
memorized.
.PP
File content encryption is performed using NaCl
SecretBox (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox), based
on XSalsa20 cipher and Poly1305 for integrity.
Names (file- and directory names) are also encrypted by default, but
this has some implications and is therefore possible to turned off.
.SS Configuration
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]secret\f[R].
.PP
To use \f[C]crypt\f[R], first set up the underlying remote.
Follow the \f[C]rclone config\f[R] instructions for the specific
backend.
.PP
Before configuring the crypt remote, check the underlying remote is
working.
In this example the underlying remote is called \f[C]remote\f[R].
We will configure a path \f[C]path\f[R] within this remote to contain
the encrypted content.
Anything inside \f[C]remote:path\f[R] will be encrypted and anything
outside will not.
.PP
Configure \f[C]crypt\f[R] using \f[C]rclone config\f[R].
In this example the \f[C]crypt\f[R] remote is called \f[C]secret\f[R],
to differentiate it from the underlying \f[C]remote\f[R].
.PP
When you are done you can use the crypt remote named \f[C]secret\f[R]
just as you would with any other remote, e.g.
\f[C]rclone copy D:\[rs]docs secret:\[rs]docs\f[R], and rclone will
encrypt and decrypt as needed on the fly.
If you access the wrapped remote \f[C]remote:path\f[R] directly you will
bypass the encryption, and anything you read will be in encrypted form,
and anything you write will be unencrypted.
To avoid issues it is best to configure a dedicated path for encrypted
content, and access it exclusively through a crypt remote.

\f[B]Important\f[R] The crypt password stored in \f[C]rclone.conf\f[R]
is lightly obscured.
That only protects it from cursory inspection.
It is not secure unless configuration
encryption (https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption) of
\f[C]rclone.conf\f[R] is specified.
.PP
A long passphrase is recommended, or \f[C]rclone config\f[R] can
generate a random one.
.PP
The obscured password is created using AES-CTR with a static key.
The salt is stored verbatim at the beginning of the obscured password.
This static key is shared between all versions of rclone.
.PP
If you reconfigure rclone with the same passwords/passphrases elsewhere
it will be compatible, but the obscured version will be different due to
the different salt.

.SS Specifying the remote
.PP
When configuring the remote to encrypt/decrypt, you may specify any
string that rclone accepts as a source/destination of other commands.
.PP
The primary use case is to specify the path into an already configured
remote (e.g.
\f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[R] or \f[C]remote:bucket\f[R]), such that data
in a remote untrusted location can be stored encrypted.
.PP
You may also specify a local filesystem path, such as
\f[C]/path/to/dir\f[R] on Linux, \f[C]C:\[rs]path\[rs]to\[rs]dir\f[R] on
Windows.
By creating a crypt remote pointing to such a local filesystem path, you
can use rclone as a utility for pure local file encryption, for example
to keep encrypted files on a removable USB drive.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: A string which do not contain a \f[C]:\f[R] will by
rclone be treated as a relative path in the local filesystem.
For example, if you enter the name \f[C]remote\f[R] without the trailing
\f[C]:\f[R], it will be treated as a subdirectory of the current
directory with name \[dq]remote\[dq].
.PP
If a path \f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[R] is specified, rclone stores
encrypted files in \f[C]path/to/dir\f[R] on the remote.
With file name encryption, files saved to
\f[C]secret:subdir/subfile\f[R] are stored in the unencrypted path
\f[C]path/to/dir\f[R] but the \f[C]subdir/subpath\f[R] element is
encrypted.
.PP
The path you specify does not have to exist, rclone will create it when
needed.
.PP
If you intend to use the wrapped remote both directly for keeping
unencrypted content, as well as through a crypt remote for encrypted
content, it is recommended to point the crypt remote to a separate
directory within the wrapped remote.
If you use a bucket-based storage system (e.g.
Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2, Hubic) it is generally advisable
to wrap the crypt remote around a specific bucket (\f[C]s3:bucket\f[R]).
If wrapping around the entire root of the storage (\f[C]s3:\f[R]), and
use the optional file name encryption, rclone will encrypt the bucket
name.
.SS Changing password
.PP
Should the password, or the configuration file containing a lightly
obscured form of the password, be compromised, you need to re-encrypt
your data with a new password.
Since rclone uses secret-key encryption, where the encryption key is
generated directly from the password kept on the client, it is not
possible to change the password/key of already encrypted content.
Just changing the password configured for an existing crypt remote means
you will no longer able to decrypt any of the previously encrypted
content.
The only possibility is to re-upload everything via a crypt remote
configured with your new password.
.PP
Depending on the size of your data, your bandwith, storage quota etc,
there are different approaches you can take: - If you have everything in
a different location, for example on your local system, you could remove
all of the prior encrypted files, change the password for your
configured crypt remote (or delete and re-create the crypt
configuration), and then re-upload everything from the alternative
location.
- If you have enough space on the storage system you can create a new
crypt remote pointing to a separate directory on the same backend, and
then use rclone to copy everything from the original crypt remote to the
new, effectively decrypting everything on the fly using the old password
and re-encrypting using the new password.
When done, delete the original crypt remote directory and finally the
rclone crypt configuration with the old password.
All data will be streamed from the storage system and back, so you will
get half the bandwith and be charged twice if you have upload and
download quota on the storage system.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: A security problem related to the random password
generator was fixed in rclone version 1.53.3 (released 2020-11-19).
Passwords generated by rclone config in version 1.49.0 (released
2019-08-26) to 1.53.2 (released 2020-10-26) are not considered secure
and should be changed.
If you made up your own password, or used rclone version older than
1.49.0 or newer than 1.53.2 to generate it, you are \f[I]not\f[R]
affected by this issue.
See issue #4783 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4783) for more
details, and a tool you can use to check if you are affected.

Obfuscation
.PP
This is a simple \[dq]rotate\[dq] of the filename, with each file having
a rot distance based on the filename.
Rclone stores the distance at the beginning of the filename.
A file called \[dq]hello\[dq] may become \[dq]53.jgnnq\[dq].
.PP
Obfuscation is not a strong encryption of filenames, but hinders
automated scanning tools picking up on filename patterns.
It is an intermediate between \[dq]off\[dq] and \[dq]standard\[dq] which
allows for longer path segment names.
.PP
There is a possibility with some unicode based filenames that the
obfuscation is weak and may map lower case characters to upper case
equivalents.
.PP
Obfuscation cannot be relied upon for strong protection.
.IP \[bu] 2

.PP
Cloud storage systems have limits on file name length and total path
length which rclone is more likely to breach using \[dq]Standard\[dq]
file name encryption.
Where file names are less than 156 characters in length issues should
not be encountered, irrespective of cloud storage provider.
.PP
An experimental advanced option \f[C]filename_encoding\f[R] is now
provided to address this problem to a certain degree.
For cloud storage systems with case sensitive file names (e.g.
Google Drive), \f[C]base64\f[R] can be used to reduce file name length.
For cloud storage systems using UTF-16 to store file names internally
(e.g.
OneDrive), \f[C]base32768\f[R] can be used to drastically reduce file
name length.
.PP
An alternative, future rclone file name encryption mode may tolerate
backend provider path length limits.
.SS Directory name encryption
.PP
Crypt offers the option of encrypting dir names or leaving them intact.
There are two options:
.PP
True
.PP
Encrypts the whole file path including directory names Example:
\f[C]1/12/123.txt\f[R] is encrypted to
\f[C]p0e52nreeaj0a5ea7s64m4j72s/l42g6771hnv3an9cgc8cr2n1ng/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0\f[R]
.PP

.PP
Only encrypts file names, skips directory names Example:
\f[C]1/12/123.txt\f[R] is encrypted to
\f[C]1/12/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0\f[R]
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
Crypt stores modification times using the underlying remote so support
depends on that.
.PP
Hashes are not stored for crypt.
However the data integrity is protected by an extremely strong crypto
authenticator.
.PP
Use the \f[C]rclone cryptcheck\f[R] command to check the integrity of a

.PP
The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.
.PP
See the \[dq]rclone backend\[dq]
command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) for more info on
how to pass options and arguments.
.PP
These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
backend/command (https://rclone.org/rc/#backend-command).
.SS encode
.PP
Encode the given filename(s)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend encode remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This encodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of
strings of the encoded results.
.PP
Usage Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend encode crypt: file1 [file2...]
rclone rc backend/command command=encode fs=crypt: file1 [file2...]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS decode
.PP
Decode the given filename(s)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend decode remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This decodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of
strings of the decoded results.
It will return an error if any of the inputs are invalid.
.PP
Usage Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend decode crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]
rclone rc backend/command command=decode fs=crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]
\f[R]

.SS Backing up a crypted remote
.PP
If you wish to backup a crypted remote, it is recommended that you use
\f[C]rclone sync\f[R] on the encrypted files, and make sure the
passwords are the same in the new encrypted remote.
.PP
This will have the following advantages
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone sync\f[R] will check the checksums while copying
.IP \[bu] 2
you can use \f[C]rclone check\f[R] between the encrypted remotes
.IP \[bu] 2
you don\[aq]t decrypt and encrypt unnecessarily
.PP
For example, let\[aq]s say you have your original remote at
\f[C]remote:\f[R] with the encrypted version at \f[C]eremote:\f[R] with
path \f[C]remote:crypt\f[R].
You would then set up the new remote \f[C]remote2:\f[R] and then the
encrypted version \f[C]eremote2:\f[R] with path \f[C]remote2:crypt\f[R]
using the same passwords as \f[C]eremote:\f[R].
.PP
To sync the two remotes you would do
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync -i remote:crypt remote2:crypt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And to check the integrity you would do
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone check remote:crypt remote2:crypt
\f[R]
.fi
.SS File formats
.SS File encryption
.PP
Files are encrypted 1:1 source file to destination object.
The file has a header and is divided into chunks.
.SS Header
.IP \[bu] 2
8 bytes magic string \f[C]RCLONE\[rs]x00\[rs]x00\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
24 bytes Nonce (IV)
.PP
The initial nonce is generated from the operating systems crypto strong
random number generator.
The nonce is incremented for each chunk read making sure each nonce is
unique for each block written.
The chance of a nonce being re-used is minuscule.
If you wrote an exabyte of data (10\[S1]\[u2078] bytes) you would have a
probability of approximately 2\[tmu]10\[u207B]\[S3]\[S2] of re-using a
nonce.
.SS Chunk
.PP
Each chunk will contain 64 KiB of data, except for the last one which
may have less data.
The data chunk is in standard NaCl SecretBox format.
SecretBox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate
messages.
.PP
Each chunk contains:
.IP \[bu] 2
16 Bytes of Poly1305 authenticator
.IP \[bu] 2
1 - 65536 bytes XSalsa20 encrypted data
.PP
64k chunk size was chosen as the best performing chunk size (the
authenticator takes too much time below this and the performance drops
off due to cache effects above this).
Note that these chunks are buffered in memory so they can\[aq]t be too
big.
.PP
This uses a 32 byte (256 bit key) key derived from the user password.
.SS Examples
.PP
1 byte file will encrypt to
.IP \[bu] 2
32 bytes header
.IP \[bu] 2
17 bytes data chunk
.PP
49 bytes total
.PP
1 MiB (1048576 bytes) file will encrypt to
.IP \[bu] 2
32 bytes header
.IP \[bu] 2
16 chunks of 65568 bytes
.PP
1049120 bytes total (a 0.05% overhead).
This is the overhead for big files.
.SS Name encryption
.PP
File names are encrypted segment by segment - the path is broken up into
\f[C]/\f[R] separated strings and these are encrypted individually.
.PP
File segments are padded using PKCS#7 to a multiple of 16 bytes before
encryption.
.PP
They are then encrypted with EME using AES with 256 bit key.
EME (ECB-Mix-ECB) is a wide-block encryption mode presented in the 2003
paper \[dq]A Parallelizable Enciphering Mode\[dq] by Halevi and Rogaway.
.PP
This makes for deterministic encryption which is what we want - the same
filename must encrypt to the same thing otherwise we can\[aq]t find it
on the cloud storage system.
.PP
This means that
.IP \[bu] 2
filenames with the same name will encrypt the same
.IP \[bu] 2
filenames which start the same won\[aq]t have a common prefix
.PP
This uses a 32 byte key (256 bits) and a 16 byte (128 bits) IV both of
which are derived from the user password.
.PP
After encryption they are written out using a modified version of
standard \f[C]base32\f[R] encoding as described in RFC4648.
The standard encoding is modified in two ways:
.IP \[bu] 2
it becomes lower case (no-one likes upper case filenames!)
.IP \[bu] 2
we strip the padding character \f[C]=\f[R]
.PP
\f[C]base32\f[R] is used rather than the more efficient \f[C]base64\f[R]
so rclone can be used on case insensitive remotes (e.g.
Windows, Amazon Drive).
.SS Key derivation
.PP
Rclone uses \f[C]scrypt\f[R] with parameters \f[C]N=16384, r=8, p=1\f[R]
with an optional user supplied salt (password2) to derive the 32+32+16 =
80 bytes of key material required.
If the user doesn\[aq]t supply a salt then rclone uses an internal one.
.PP
\f[C]scrypt\f[R] makes it impractical to mount a dictionary attack on
rclone encrypted data.
For full protection against this you should always use a salt.

.SS Compression Modes
.PP
Currently only gzip compression is supported.
It provides a decent balance between speed and size and is well
supported by other applications.
Compression strength can further be configured via an advanced setting
where 0 is no compression and 9 is strongest compression.
.SS File types
.PP
If you open a remote wrapped by compress, you will see that there are
many files with an extension corresponding to the compression algorithm
you chose.
These files are standard files that can be opened by various archive
programs, but they have some hidden metadata that allows them to be used
by rclone.
While you may download and decompress these files at will, do
\f[B]not\f[R] manually delete or rename files.
Files without correct metadata files will not be recognized by rclone.
.SS File names
.PP
The compressed files will be named \f[C]*.###########.gz\f[R] where
\f[C]*\f[R] is the base file and the \f[C]#\f[R] part is base64 encoded
size of the uncompressed file.
The file names should not be changed by anything other than the rclone
compression backend.

.SS Dropbox for business
.PP
Rclone supports Dropbox for business and Team Folders.
.PP
When using Dropbox for business \f[C]remote:\f[R] and
\f[C]remote:path/to/file\f[R] will refer to your personal folder.
.PP
If you wish to see Team Folders you must use a leading \f[C]/\f[R] in
the path, so \f[C]rclone lsd remote:/\f[R] will refer to the root and
show you all Team Folders and your User Folder.
.PP
You can then use team folders like this \f[C]remote:/TeamFolder\f[R] and
\f[C]remote:/TeamFolder/path/to/file\f[R].
.PP
A leading \f[C]/\f[R] for a Dropbox personal account will do nothing,
but it will take an extra HTTP transaction so it should be avoided.
.SS Modified time and Hashes
.PP
Dropbox supports modified times, but the only way to set a modification
time is to re-upload the file.
.PP
This means that if you uploaded your data with an older version of
rclone which didn\[aq]t support the v2 API and modified times, rclone
will decide to upload all your old data to fix the modification times.
If you don\[aq]t want this to happen use \f[C]--size-only\f[R] or
\f[C]--checksum\f[R] flag to stop it.
.PP
Dropbox supports its own hash
type (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash) which
is checked for all transfers.

be used in JSON strings.
.SS Batch mode uploads
.PP
Using batch mode uploads is very important for performance when using
the Dropbox API.
See the dropbox performance
guide (https://developers.dropbox.com/dbx-performance-guide) for more
info.
.PP
There are 3 modes rclone can use for uploads.
.SS --dropbox-batch-mode off
.PP
In this mode rclone will not use upload batching.
This was the default before rclone v1.55.
It has the disadvantage that it is very likely to encounter
\f[C]too_many_requests\f[R] errors like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
NOTICE: too_many_requests/.: Too many requests or write operations. Trying again in 15 seconds.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When rclone receives these it has to wait for 15s or sometimes 300s
before continuing which really slows down transfers.
.PP
This will happen especially if \f[C]--transfers\f[R] is large, so this
mode isn\[aq]t recommended except for compatibility or investigating
problems.
.SS --dropbox-batch-mode sync
.PP
In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by
\f[C]--dropbox-batch-size\f[R] and commit them together.
.PP
Using this mode means you can use a much higher \f[C]--transfers\f[R]
parameter (32 or 64 works fine) without receiving
\f[C]too_many_requests\f[R] errors.
.PP
This mode ensures full data integrity.
.PP
Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone
finishes up the last batch using this mode.
.SS --dropbox-batch-mode async
.PP
In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by
\f[C]--dropbox-batch-size\f[R] and commit them together.
.PP
However it will not wait for the status of the batch to be returned to
the caller.
This means rclone can use a much bigger batch size (much bigger than
\f[C]--transfers\f[R]), at the cost of not being able to check the
status of the upload.
.PP
This provides the maximum possible upload speed especially with lots of
small files, however rclone can\[aq]t check the file got uploaded
properly using this mode.
.PP
If you are using this mode then using \[dq]rclone check\[dq] after the
transfer completes is recommended.
Or you could do an initial transfer with
\f[C]--dropbox-batch-mode async\f[R] then do a final transfer with
\f[C]--dropbox-batch-mode sync\f[R] (the default).
.PP
Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone
finishes up the last batch using this mode.
.SS Standard options
.PP
Here are the standard options specific to dropbox (Dropbox).

.SS --dropbox-chunk-size
.PP
Upload chunk size (< 150Mi).
.PP
Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of this size.
.PP
Note that chunks are buffered in memory (one at a time) so rclone can
deal with retries.
Setting this larger will increase the speed slightly (at most 10% for
128 MiB in tests) at the cost of using more memory.
It can be set smaller if you are tight on memory.
.PP
Properties:
.IP \[bu] 2
Config: chunk_size
.IP \[bu] 2
Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_CHUNK_SIZE
.IP \[bu] 2

.SS --dropbox-impersonate
.PP
Impersonate this user when using a business account.
.PP
Note that if you want to use impersonate, you should make sure this flag
is set when running \[dq]rclone config\[dq] as this will cause rclone to
request the \[dq]members.read\[dq] scope which it won\[aq]t normally.
This is needed to lookup a members email address into the internal ID
that dropbox uses in the API.
.PP
Using the \[dq]members.read\[dq] scope will require a Dropbox Team Admin
to approve during the OAuth flow.
.PP
You will have to use your own App (setting your own client_id and
client_secret) to use this option as currently rclone\[aq]s default set
of permissions doesn\[aq]t include \[dq]members.read\[dq].
This can be added once v1.55 or later is in use everywhere.

.SS --dropbox-shared-files
.PP
Instructs rclone to work on individual shared files.
.PP
In this mode rclone\[aq]s features are extremely limited - only list
(ls, lsl, etc.) operations and read operations (e.g.
downloading) are supported in this mode.
All other operations will be disabled.
.PP
Properties:

.IP \[bu] 2
Default: false
.SS --dropbox-shared-folders
.PP
Instructs rclone to work on shared folders.
.PP
When this flag is used with no path only the List operation is supported
and all available shared folders will be listed.
If you specify a path the first part will be interpreted as the name of
shared folder.
Rclone will then try to mount this shared to the root namespace.
On success shared folder rclone proceeds normally.
The shared folder is now pretty much a normal folder and all normal
operations are supported.
.PP
Note that we don\[aq]t unmount the shared folder afterwards so the
--dropbox-shared-folders can be omitted after the first use of a
particular shared folder.
.PP
Properties:

.SS --dropbox-batch-mode
.PP
Upload file batching sync|async|off.
.PP
This sets the batch mode used by rclone.
.PP
For full info see the main docs (https://rclone.org/dropbox/#batch-mode)
.PP
This has 3 possible values
.IP \[bu] 2
off - no batching
.IP \[bu] 2
sync - batch uploads and check completion (default)
.IP \[bu] 2
async - batch upload and don\[aq]t check completion

.SS --dropbox-batch-size
.PP
Max number of files in upload batch.
.PP
This sets the batch size of files to upload.
It has to be less than 1000.
.PP
By default this is 0 which means rclone which calculate the batch size
depending on the setting of batch_mode.
.IP \[bu] 2
batch_mode: async - default batch_size is 100
.IP \[bu] 2
batch_mode: sync - default batch_size is the same as --transfers
.IP \[bu] 2
batch_mode: off - not in use
.PP
Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make a
delay on quit.
.PP
Setting this is a great idea if you are uploading lots of small files as
it will make them a lot quicker.
You can use --transfers 32 to maximise throughput.

.SS --dropbox-batch-timeout
.PP
Max time to allow an idle upload batch before uploading.
.PP
If an upload batch is idle for more than this long then it will be
uploaded.
.PP
The default for this is 0 which means rclone will choose a sensible
default based on the batch_mode in use.
.IP \[bu] 2
batch_mode: async - default batch_timeout is 500ms

.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file
called \[dq]Hello.doc\[dq] and one called \[dq]hello.doc\[dq].
.PP
There are some file names such as \f[C]thumbs.db\f[R] which Dropbox
can\[aq]t store.
There is a full list of them in the \[dq]Ignored Files\[dq] section of
this document (https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145).
Rclone will issue an error message
\f[C]File name disallowed - not uploading\f[R] if it attempts to upload
one of those file names, but the sync won\[aq]t fail.
.PP
Some errors may occur if you try to sync copyright-protected files
because Dropbox has its own copyright
detector (https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/30/how-dropbox-knows-when-youre-sharing-copyrighted-stuff-without-actually-looking-at-your-stuff/)
that prevents this sort of file being downloaded.
This will return the error
\f[C]ERROR : /path/to/your/file: Failed to copy: failed to open source object: path/restricted_content/.\f[R]
.PP
If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then
\f[C]rclone purge dropbox:dir\f[R] will return the error
\f[C]Failed to purge: There are too many files involved in this operation\f[R].
As a work-around do an \f[C]rclone delete dropbox:dir\f[R] followed by
an \f[C]rclone rmdir dropbox:dir\f[R].
.PP
When using \f[C]rclone link\f[R] you\[aq]ll need to set
\f[C]--expire\f[R] if using a non-personal account otherwise the
visibility may not be correct.
(Note that \f[C]--expire\f[R] isn\[aq]t supported on personal accounts).
See the forum
discussion (https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-link-dropbox-permissions/23211)
and the dropbox SDK
issue (https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-go-unofficial/issues/75).
.SS Get your own Dropbox App ID
.PP
When you use rclone with Dropbox in its default configuration you are
using rclone\[aq]s App ID.
This is shared between all the rclone users.
.PP
Here is how to create your own Dropbox App ID for rclone:
.IP "1." 3
Log into the Dropbox App
console (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create) with your
Dropbox Account (It need not to be the same account as the Dropbox you
want to access)
.IP "2." 3
Choose an API => Usually this should be \f[C]Dropbox API\f[R]
.IP "3." 3
Choose the type of access you want to use => \f[C]Full Dropbox\f[R] or
\f[C]App Folder\f[R]
.IP "4." 3
Name your App.
The app name is global, so you can\[aq]t use \f[C]rclone\f[R] for
example
.IP "5." 3
Click the button \f[C]Create App\f[R]
.IP "6." 3
Switch to the \f[C]Permissions\f[R] tab.
Enable at least the following permissions: \f[C]account_info.read\f[R],
\f[C]files.metadata.write\f[R], \f[C]files.content.write\f[R],
\f[C]files.content.read\f[R], \f[C]sharing.write\f[R].
The \f[C]files.metadata.read\f[R] and \f[C]sharing.read\f[R] checkboxes
will be marked too.
Click \f[C]Submit\f[R]
.IP "7." 3
Switch to the \f[C]Settings\f[R] tab.
Fill \f[C]OAuth2 - Redirect URIs\f[R] as
\f[C]http://localhost:53682/\f[R]
.IP "8." 3
Find the \f[C]App key\f[R] and \f[C]App secret\f[R] values on the
\f[C]Settings\f[R] tab.
Use these values in rclone config to add a new remote or edit an
existing remote.
The \f[C]App key\f[R] setting corresponds to \f[C]client_id\f[R] in
rclone config, the \f[C]App secret\f[R] corresponds to
\f[C]client_secret\f[R]
.SH Enterprise File Fabric
.PP
This backend supports Storage Made Easy\[aq]s Enterprise File
Fabric\[tm] (https://storagemadeeasy.com/about/) which provides a
software solution to integrate and unify File and Object Storage
accessible through a global file system.
.SS Configuration
.PP
The initial setup for the Enterprise File Fabric backend involves
getting a token from the the Enterprise File Fabric which you need to do
in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.

backup
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
The Enterprise File Fabric allows modification times to be set on files
accurate to 1 second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
The Enterprise File Fabric does not support any data hashes at this
time.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
The default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) will be
replaced.
.PP
Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.SS Empty files
.PP
Empty files aren\[aq]t supported by the Enterprise File Fabric.
Rclone will therefore upload an empty file as a single space with a mime
type of \f[C]application/vnd.rclone.empty.file\f[R] and files with that
mime type are treated as empty.
.SS Root folder ID
.PP
You can set the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] for rclone.
This is the directory (identified by its \f[C]Folder ID\f[R]) that
rclone considers to be the root of your Enterprise File Fabric.
.PP
Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.
.PP
However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.
.PP
In order to do this you will have to find the \f[C]Folder ID\f[R] of the
directory you wish rclone to display.
These aren\[aq]t displayed in the web interface, but you can use
\f[C]rclone lsf\f[R] to find them, for example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone lsf --dirs-only -Fip --csv filefabric:
120673758,Burnt PDFs/
120673759,My Quick Uploads/
120673755,My Syncs/
120673756,My backups/
120673757,My contacts/
120673761,S3 Storage/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The ID for \[dq]S3 Storage\[dq] would be \f[C]120673761\f[R].

.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R].
If the path does not begin with a \f[C]/\f[R] it is relative to the home
directory of the user.
An empty path \f[C]remote:\f[R] refers to the user\[aq]s home directory.

.SS Limitations
.PP
FTP servers acting as rclone remotes must support \f[C]passive\f[R]
mode.
The mode cannot be configured as \f[C]passive\f[R] is the only supported
one.
Rclone\[aq]s FTP implementation is not compatible with \f[C]active\f[R]
mode as the library it uses doesn\[aq]t support
it (https://github.com/jlaffaye/ftp/issues/29).
This will likely never be supported due to security concerns.
.PP
Rclone\[aq]s FTP backend does not support any checksums but can compare
file sizes.
.PP
\f[C]rclone about\f[R] is not supported by the FTP backend.
Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount or use policy \f[C]mfs\f[R] (most free space) as a member
of an rclone union remote.
.PP
See List of backends that do not support rclone
about (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) See rclone
about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
.PP
The implementation of : \f[C]--dump headers\f[R],
\f[C]--dump bodies\f[R], \f[C]--dump auth\f[R] for debugging isn\[aq]t
the same as for rclone HTTP based backends - it has less fine grained
control.
.PP
\f[C]--timeout\f[R] isn\[aq]t supported (but \f[C]--contimeout\f[R] is).
.PP
\f[C]--bind\f[R] isn\[aq]t supported.
.PP
Rclone\[aq]s FTP backend could support server-side move but does not at
present.
.PP
The \f[C]ftp_proxy\f[R] environment variable is not currently supported.
.SS Modified time
.PP
File modification time (timestamps) is supported to 1 second resolution
for major FTP servers: ProFTPd, PureFTPd, VsFTPd, and FileZilla FTP
server.
The \f[C]VsFTPd\f[R] server has non-standard implementation of time
related protocol commands and needs a special configuration setting:
\f[C]writing_mdtm = true\f[R].
.PP
Support for precise file time with other FTP servers varies depending on
what protocol extensions they advertise.
If all the \f[C]MLSD\f[R], \f[C]MDTM\f[R] and \f[C]MFTM\f[R] extensions
are present, rclone will use them together to provide precise time.
Otherwise the times you see on the FTP server through rclone are those
of the last file upload.
.PP
You can use the following command to check whether rclone can use
precise time with your FTP server:
\f[C]rclone backend features your_ftp_remote:\f[R] (the trailing colon
is important).
Look for the number in the line tagged by \f[C]Precision\f[R]
designating the remote time precision expressed as nanoseconds.
A value of \f[C]1000000000\f[R] means that file time precision of 1
second is available.
A value of \f[C]3153600000000000000\f[R] (or another large number) means
\[dq]unsupported\[dq].
.SH Google Cloud Storage
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:bucket\f[R] (or \f[C]remote:\f[R] for
the \f[C]lsd\f[R] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, e.g.
\f[C]remote:bucket/path/to/dir\f[R].
.SS Configuration
.PP
The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from
Google Cloud Storage which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP

This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.

.SS Service Account support
.PP
You can set up rclone with Google Cloud Storage in an unattended mode,
i.e.
not tied to a specific end-user Google account.
This is useful when you want to synchronise files onto machines that
don\[aq]t have actively logged-in users, for example build machines.
.PP
To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform IAM Service
Accounts (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts), please
head to the Service
Account (https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts)
section of the Google Developer Console.
Service Accounts behave just like normal \f[C]User\f[R] permissions in
Google Cloud Storage
ACLs (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control), so you can
limit their access (e.g.
make them read only).
After creating an account, a JSON file containing the Service
Account\[aq]s credentials will be downloaded onto your machines.
These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.
.PP
To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the \f[C]service_account_file\f[R]
prompt and rclone won\[aq]t use the browser based authentication flow.
If you\[aq]d rather stuff the contents of the credentials file into the
rclone config file, you can set \f[C]service_account_credentials\f[R]
with the actual contents of the file instead, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
.SS Anonymous Access
.PP
For downloads of objects that permit public access you can configure
rclone to use anonymous access by setting \f[C]anonymous\f[R] to
\f[C]true\f[R].
With unauthorized access you can\[aq]t write or create files but only
read or list those buckets and objects that have public read access.
.SS Application Default Credentials
.PP
If no other source of credentials is provided, rclone will fall back to
Application Default
Credentials (https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth#authenticating_with_application_default_credentials)
this is useful both when you already have configured authentication for
your developer account, or in production when running on a google
compute host.
Note that if running in docker, you may need to run additional commands
on your google compute machine - see this
page (https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#gcloud_as_a_docker_credential_helper).
.PP
Note that in the case application default credentials are used, there is
no need to explicitly configure a project number.
.SS --fast-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS Custom upload headers
.PP
You can set custom upload headers with the \f[C]--header-upload\f[R]
flag.

.SS Modification time
.PP
Google Cloud Storage stores md5sum natively.
Google\[aq]s gsutil (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) tool
stores modification time with one-second precision as
\f[C]goog-reserved-file-mtime\f[R] in file metadata.
.PP
To ensure compatibility with gsutil, rclone stores modification time in
2 separate metadata entries.
\f[C]mtime\f[R] uses RFC3339 format with one-nanosecond precision.
\f[C]goog-reserved-file-mtime\f[R] uses Unix timestamp format with
one-second precision.
To get modification time from object metadata, rclone reads the metadata
in the following order: \f[C]mtime\f[R],
\f[C]goog-reserved-file-mtime\f[R], object updated time.
.PP
Note that rclone\[aq]s default modify window is 1ns.
Files uploaded by gsutil only contain timestamps with one-second
precision.
If you use rclone to sync files previously uploaded by gsutil, rclone
will attempt to update modification time for all these files.
To avoid these possibly unnecessary updates, use
\f[C]--modify-window 1s\f[R].

which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.

.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use manual
mode.
.PP
You can then use it like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your drive
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
List all the files in your drive
.IP

\f[C]
rclone ls remote:

.fi
.PP

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Scopes
.PP
Rclone allows you to select which scope you would like for rclone to
use.
This changes what type of token is granted to rclone.
The scopes are defined
here (https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about-auth).
.PP
The scope are
.SS drive
.PP
This is the default scope and allows full access to all files, except
for the Application Data Folder (see below).
.PP
Choose this one if you aren\[aq]t sure.
.SS drive.readonly
.PP
This allows read only access to all files.
Files may be listed and downloaded but not uploaded, renamed or deleted.
.SS drive.file
.PP
With this scope rclone can read/view/modify only those files and folders
it creates.
.PP
So if you uploaded files to drive via the web interface (or any other
means) they will not be visible to rclone.
.PP
This can be useful if you are using rclone to backup data and you want
to be sure confidential data on your drive is not visible to rclone.
.PP
Files created with this scope are visible in the web interface.
.SS drive.appfolder
.PP
This gives rclone its own private area to store files.
Rclone will not be able to see any other files on your drive and you
won\[aq]t be able to see rclone\[aq]s files from the web interface
either.
.SS drive.metadata.readonly
.PP
This allows read only access to file names only.
It does not allow rclone to download or upload data, or rename or delete
files or directories.
.SS Root folder ID
.PP
You can set the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] for rclone.
This is the directory (identified by its \f[C]Folder ID\f[R]) that
rclone considers to be the root of your drive.
.PP
Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.
.PP
However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy or to access data within the \[dq]Computers\[dq] tab on the
drive web interface (where files from Google\[aq]s Backup and Sync
desktop program go).
.PP
In order to do this you will have to find the \f[C]Folder ID\f[R] of the
directory you wish rclone to display.
This will be the last segment of the URL when you open the relevant
folder in the drive web interface.
.PP
So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
\f[C]https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh\f[R]
in the browser, then you use \f[C]1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh\f[R]
as the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] in the config.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] folders under the \[dq]Computers\[dq] tab seem to be read
only (drive gives a 500 error) when using rclone.
.PP
There doesn\[aq]t appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the
\[dq]Computers\[dq] tab - please contact us if you know otherwise!
.PP
Note also that rclone can\[aq]t access any data under the
\[dq]Backups\[dq] tab on the google drive web interface yet.
.SS Service Account support
.PP
You can set up rclone with Google Drive in an unattended mode, i.e.
not tied to a specific end-user Google account.
This is useful when you want to synchronise files onto machines that
don\[aq]t have actively logged-in users, for example build machines.
.PP
To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the \f[C]service_account_file\f[R]
prompt during \f[C]rclone config\f[R] and rclone won\[aq]t use the
browser based authentication flow.
If you\[aq]d rather stuff the contents of the credentials file into the
rclone config file, you can set \f[C]service_account_credentials\f[R]
with the actual contents of the file instead, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
.SS Use case - Google Apps/G-suite account and individual Drive
.PP
Let\[aq]s say that you are the administrator of a Google Apps (old) or
G-suite account.
The goal is to store data on an individual\[aq]s Drive account, who IS a
member of the domain.
We\[aq]ll call the domain \f[B]example.com\f[R], and the user
\f[B]foo\[at]example.com\f[R].
.PP
There\[aq]s a few steps we need to go through to accomplish this:
.SS 1. Create a service account for example.com
.IP \[bu] 2
To create a service account and obtain its credentials, go to the Google
Developer Console (https://console.developers.google.com).
.IP \[bu] 2
You must have a project - create one if you don\[aq]t.
.IP \[bu] 2
Then go to \[dq]IAM & admin\[dq] -> \[dq]Service Accounts\[dq].
.IP \[bu] 2
Use the \[dq]Create Credentials\[dq] button.
Fill in \[dq]Service account name\[dq] with something that identifies
your client.
\[dq]Role\[dq] can be empty.
.IP \[bu] 2
Tick \[dq]Furnish a new private key\[dq] - select \[dq]Key type
JSON\[dq].
.IP \[bu] 2
Tick \[dq]Enable G Suite Domain-wide Delegation\[dq].
This option makes \[dq]impersonation\[dq] possible, as documented here:
Delegating domain-wide authority to the service
account (https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority)
.IP \[bu] 2
These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.
If you ever need to remove access, press the \[dq]Delete service account
key\[dq] button.
.SS 2. Allowing API access to example.com Google Drive
.IP \[bu] 2
Go to example.com\[aq]s admin console
.IP \[bu] 2
Go into \[dq]Security\[dq] (or use the search bar)
.IP \[bu] 2
Select \[dq]Show more\[dq] and then \[dq]Advanced settings\[dq]
.IP \[bu] 2
Select \[dq]Manage API client access\[dq] in the
\[dq]Authentication\[dq] section
.IP \[bu] 2
In the \[dq]Client Name\[dq] field enter the service account\[aq]s
\[dq]Client ID\[dq] - this can be found in the Developer Console under
\[dq]IAM & Admin\[dq] -> \[dq]Service Accounts\[dq], then \[dq]View
Client ID\[dq] for the newly created service account.
It is a \[ti]21 character numerical string.
.IP \[bu] 2
In the next field, \[dq]One or More API Scopes\[dq], enter
\f[C]https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\f[R] to grant access to
Google Drive specifically.
.SS 3. Configure rclone, assuming a new install
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config

n/s/q> n         # New

y/n>             # Auto config, n
\f[R]
.fi
.SS 4. Verify that it\[aq]s working
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone -v --drive-impersonate foo\[at]example.com lsf gdrive:backup\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
The arguments do:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]-v\f[R] - verbose logging
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--drive-impersonate foo\[at]example.com\f[R] - this is what does
the magic, pretending to be user foo.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]lsf\f[R] - list files in a parsing friendly way
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]gdrive:backup\f[R] - use the remote called gdrive, work in the
folder named backup.
.RE
.PP
Note: in case you configured a specific root folder on gdrive and rclone
is unable to access the contents of that folder when using
\f[C]--drive-impersonate\f[R], do this instead: - in the gdrive web
interface, share your root folder with the user/email of the new Service
Account you created/selected at step #1 - use rclone without specifying
the \f[C]--drive-impersonate\f[R] option, like this:
\f[C]rclone -v lsf gdrive:backup\f[R]
.SS Shared drives (team drives)
.PP
If you want to configure the remote to point to a Google Shared Drive
(previously known as Team Drives) then answer \f[C]y\f[R] to the
question \f[C]Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?\f[R].
.PP
This will fetch the list of Shared Drives from google and allow you to
configure which one you want to use.
You can also type in a Shared Drive ID if you prefer.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y

.SS --fast-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.PP
It does this by combining multiple \f[C]list\f[R] calls into a single
API request.
.PP
This works by combining many \f[C]\[aq]%s\[aq] in parents\f[R] filters
into one expression.
To list the contents of directories a, b and c, the following requests
will be send by the regular \f[C]List\f[R] function:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
trashed=false and \[aq]a\[aq] in parents
trashed=false and \[aq]b\[aq] in parents
trashed=false and \[aq]c\[aq] in parents
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
These can now be combined into a single request:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
trashed=false and (\[aq]a\[aq] in parents or \[aq]b\[aq] in parents or \[aq]c\[aq] in parents)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The implementation of \f[C]ListR\f[R] will put up to 50
\f[C]parents\f[R] filters into one request.
It will use the \f[C]--checkers\f[R] value to specify the number of
requests to run in parallel.
.PP
In tests, these batch requests were up to 20x faster than the regular
method.
Running the following command against different sized folders gives:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsjson -vv -R --checkers=6 gdrive:folder
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
small folder (220 directories, 700 files):
.IP \[bu] 2
without \f[C]--fast-list\f[R]: 38s
.IP \[bu] 2
with \f[C]--fast-list\f[R]: 10s
.PP
large folder (10600 directories, 39000 files):
.IP \[bu] 2
without \f[C]--fast-list\f[R]: 22:05 min
.IP \[bu] 2
with \f[C]--fast-list\f[R]: 58s
.SS Modified time
.PP
Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
Only Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.PP
In contrast to other backends, \f[C]/\f[R] can also be used in names and
\f[C].\f[R] or \f[C]..\f[R] are valid names.
.SS Revisions
.PP
Google drive stores revisions of files.
When you upload a change to an existing file to google drive using
rclone it will create a new revision of that file.
.PP
Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing was
.IP \[bu] 2
They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).
.IP \[bu] 2
They do not count towards a user storage quota.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
If deleting them permanently is required then use the
\f[C]--drive-use-trash=false\f[R] flag, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
.SS Shortcuts
.PP
In March 2020 Google introduced a new feature in Google Drive called
drive shortcuts (https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9700156)
(API (https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/shortcuts)).
These will (by September 2020) replace the ability for files or folders
to be in multiple folders at
once (https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/simplifying-google-drives-folder-structure-and-sharing-models).
.PP
Shortcuts are files that link to other files on Google Drive somewhat
like a symlink in unix, except they point to the underlying file data
(e.g.
the inode in unix terms) so they don\[aq]t break if the source is
renamed or moved about.
.PP
Be default rclone treats these as follows.
.PP
For shortcuts pointing to files:
.IP \[bu] 2
When listing a file shortcut appears as the destination file.
.IP \[bu] 2
When downloading the contents of the destination file is downloaded.
.IP \[bu] 2
When updating shortcut file with a non shortcut file, the shortcut is
removed then a new file is uploaded in place of the shortcut.
.IP \[bu] 2
When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the
destination file.
.IP \[bu] 2
When server-side copying the shortcut is copied, not the contents of the
shortcut.
(unless \f[C]--drive-copy-shortcut-content\f[R] is in use in which case
the contents of the shortcut gets copied).
.IP \[bu] 2
When deleting the shortcut is deleted not the linked file.
.IP \[bu] 2
When setting the modification time, the modification time of the linked
file will be set.
.PP
For shortcuts pointing to folders:
.IP \[bu] 2
When listing the shortcut appears as a folder and that folder will
contain the contents of the linked folder appear (including any sub
folders)
.IP \[bu] 2
When downloading the contents of the linked folder and sub contents are
downloaded
.IP \[bu] 2
When uploading to a shortcut folder the file will be placed in the
linked folder
.IP \[bu] 2
When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the
destination folder
.IP \[bu] 2
When server-side copying the contents of the linked folder is copied,
not the shortcut.
.IP \[bu] 2
When deleting with \f[C]rclone rmdir\f[R] or \f[C]rclone purge\f[R] the
shortcut is deleted not the linked folder.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]NB\f[R] When deleting with \f[C]rclone remove\f[R] or
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R] the contents of the linked folder will be
deleted.
.PP
The rclone backend (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command
can be used to create shortcuts.
.PP
Shortcuts can be completely ignored with the
\f[C]--drive-skip-shortcuts\f[R] flag or the corresponding
\f[C]skip_shortcuts\f[R] configuration setting.
.SS Emptying trash
.PP
If you wish to empty your trash you can use the
\f[C]rclone cleanup remote:\f[R] command which will permanently delete
all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.PP
Note that Google Drive takes some time (minutes to days) to empty the
trash even though the command returns within a few seconds.
No output is echoed, so there will be no confirmation even using -v or
-vv.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone about remote:\f[R] command which will display your usage
limit (quota), the usage in Google Drive, the size of all files in the
Trash and the space used by other Google services such as Gmail.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.SS Import/Export of google documents
.PP
Google documents can be exported from and uploaded to Google Drive.
.PP
When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download
depending upon the \f[C]--drive-export-formats\f[R] setting.
By default the export formats are \f[C]docx,xlsx,pptx,svg\f[R] which are
a sensible default for an editable document.
.PP
When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order and
chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the list.
If the file can\[aq]t be exported to a format on the formats list, then
rclone will choose a format from the default list.
.PP
If you prefer an archive copy then you might use
\f[C]--drive-export-formats pdf\f[R], or if you prefer
openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use
\f[C]--drive-export-formats ods,odt,odp\f[R].
.PP
Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is
called \f[C]My Spreadsheet\f[R] on google docs, it will be exported as
\f[C]My Spreadsheet.xlsx\f[R] or \f[C]My Spreadsheet.pdf\f[R] etc.
.PP
When importing files into Google Drive, rclone will convert all files
with an extension in \f[C]--drive-import-formats\f[R] to their
associated document type.
rclone will not convert any files by default, since the conversion is
lossy process.
.PP
The conversion must result in a file with the same extension when the
\f[C]--drive-export-formats\f[R] rules are applied to the uploaded
document.
.PP
Here are some examples for allowed and prohibited conversions.

.PP
This limitation can be disabled by specifying
\f[C]--drive-allow-import-name-change\f[R].
When using this flag, rclone can convert multiple files types resulting
in the same document type at once, e.g.
with \f[C]--drive-import-formats docx,odt,txt\f[R], all files having
these extension would result in a document represented as a docx file.
This brings the additional risk of overwriting a document, if multiple
files have the same stem.
Many rclone operations will not handle this name change in any way.
They assume an equal name when copying files and might copy the file
again or delete them when the name changes.
.PP
Here are the possible export extensions with their corresponding mime
types.
Most of these can also be used for importing, but there more that are
not listed here.
Some of these additional ones might only be available when the operating
system provides the correct MIME type entries.
.PP
This list can be changed by Google Drive at any time and might not
represent the currently available conversions.

.SS shortcut
.PP
Create shortcuts from files or directories
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend shortcut remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This command creates shortcuts from files or directories.
.PP
Usage:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item destination_shortcut
rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item -o target=drive2: destination_shortcut
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In the first example this creates a shortcut from the
\[dq]source_item\[dq] which can be a file or a directory to the
\[dq]destination_shortcut\[dq].
The \[dq]source_item\[dq] and the \[dq]destination_shortcut\[dq] should
be relative paths from \[dq]drive:\[dq]
.PP
In the second example this creates a shortcut from the
\[dq]source_item\[dq] relative to \[dq]drive:\[dq] to the
\[dq]destination_shortcut\[dq] relative to \[dq]drive2:\[dq].
This may fail with a permission error if the user authenticated with
\[dq]drive2:\[dq] can\[aq]t read files from \[dq]drive:\[dq].
.PP
Options:
.IP \[bu] 2
\[dq]target\[dq]: optional target remote for the shortcut destination
.SS drives

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend drives remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This command lists the Shared Drives (Team Drives) available to this
account.
.PP
Usage:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend [-o config] drives drive:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will return a JSON list of objects like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[
    {
        \[dq]id\[dq]: \[dq]0ABCDEF-01234567890\[dq],
        \[dq]kind\[dq]: \[dq]drive#teamDrive\[dq],
        \[dq]name\[dq]: \[dq]My Drive\[dq]
    },
    {
        \[dq]id\[dq]: \[dq]0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl\[dq],
        \[dq]kind\[dq]: \[dq]drive#teamDrive\[dq],
        \[dq]name\[dq]: \[dq]Test Drive\[dq]
    }
]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
With the -o config parameter it will output the list in a format
suitable for adding to a config file to make aliases for all the drives
found.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[My Drive]
type = alias
remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEF-01234567890,root_folder_id=:

[Test Drive]
type = alias
remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl,root_folder_id=:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Adding this to the rclone config file will cause those team drives to be
accessible with the aliases shown.
This may require manual editing of the names.
.SS untrash
.PP
Untrash files and directories
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend untrash remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP

passed in recursively.
.PP
Usage:
.PP
This takes an optional directory to trash which make this easier to use
via the API.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend untrash drive:directory
rclone backend -i untrash drive:directory subdir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP

.PP
Result:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]Untrashed\[dq]: 17,
    \[dq]Errors\[dq]: 0
}
\f[R]
.fi
.SS copyid
.PP
Copy files by ID
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend copyid remote: [options] [<arguments>+]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This command copies files by ID
.PP
Usage:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend copyid drive: ID path
rclone backend copyid drive: ID1 path1 ID2 path2
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
It copies the drive file with ID given to the path (an rclone path which
will be passed internally to rclone copyto).
The ID and path pairs can be repeated.
.PP
The path should end with a / to indicate copy the file as named to this
directory.
If it doesn\[aq]t end with a / then the last path component will be used
as the file name.
.PP
If the destination is a drive backend then server-side copying will be
attempted if possible.
.PP
Use the -i flag to see what would be copied before copying.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting.
This causes rclone to be limited to transferring about 2 files per
second only.
Individual files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MiB/s but
lots of small files can take a long time.
.PP
Server side copies are also subject to a separate rate limit.
If you see User rate limit exceeded errors, wait at least 24 hours and
retry.
You can disable server-side copies with \f[C]--disable copy\f[R] to
download and upload the files if you prefer.
.SS Limitations of Google Docs
.PP
Google docs will appear as size -1 in \f[C]rclone ls\f[R] and as size 0
in anything which uses the VFS layer, e.g.
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R], \f[C]rclone serve\f[R].
.PP
This is because rclone can\[aq]t find out the size of the Google docs
without downloading them.
.PP
Google docs will transfer correctly with \f[C]rclone sync\f[R],
\f[C]rclone copy\f[R] etc as rclone knows to ignore the size when doing
the transfer.
.PP
However an unfortunate consequence of this is that you may not be able
to download Google docs using \f[C]rclone mount\f[R].
If it doesn\[aq]t work you will get a 0 sized file.
If you try again the doc may gain its correct size and be downloadable.
Whether it will work on not depends on the application accessing the
mount and the OS you are running - experiment to find out if it does
work for you!
.SS Duplicated files
.PP
Sometimes, for no reason I\[aq]ve been able to track down, drive will
duplicate a file that rclone uploads.
Drive unlike all the other remotes can have duplicated files.
.PP
Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.
.PP
Use \f[C]rclone dedupe\f[R] to fix duplicated files.
.PP
Note that this isn\[aq]t just a problem with rclone, even Google Photos
on Android duplicates files on drive sometimes.
.SS Rclone appears to be re-copying files it shouldn\[aq]t
.PP
The most likely cause of this is the duplicated file issue above - run
\f[C]rclone dedupe\f[R] and check your logs for duplicate object or
directory messages.
.PP
This can also be caused by a delay/caching on google drive\[aq]s end
when comparing directory listings.
Specifically with team drives used in combination with --fast-list.
Files that were uploaded recently may not appear on the directory list
sent to rclone when using --fast-list.
.PP
Waiting a moderate period of time between attempts (estimated to be
approximately 1 hour) and/or not using --fast-list both seem to be
effective in preventing the problem.
.SS Making your own client_id
.PP
When you use rclone with Google drive in its default configuration you
are using rclone\[aq]s client_id.
This is shared between all the rclone users.
There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per second that
each client_id can do set by Google.
rclone already has a high quota and I will continue to make sure it is
high enough by contacting Google.
.PP
It is strongly recommended to use your own client ID as the default
rclone ID is heavily used.
If you have multiple services running, it is recommended to use an API
key for each service.
The default Google quota is 10 transactions per second so it is
recommended to stay under that number as if you use more than that, it
will cause rclone to rate limit and make things slower.
.PP
Here is how to create your own Google Drive client ID for rclone:
.IP "1." 3
Log into the Google API Console (https://console.developers.google.com/)
with your Google account.
It doesn\[aq]t matter what Google account you use.
(It need not be the same account as the Google Drive you want to access)
.IP "2." 3
Select a project or create a new project.
.IP "3." 3
Under \[dq]ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES\[dq] search for \[dq]Drive\[dq], and
enable the \[dq]Google Drive API\[dq].
.IP "4." 3
Click \[dq]Credentials\[dq] in the left-side panel (not \[dq]Create
credentials\[dq], which opens the wizard), then \[dq]Create
credentials\[dq]
.IP "5." 3
If you already configured an \[dq]Oauth Consent Screen\[dq], then skip
to the next step; if not, click on \[dq]CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN\[dq]
button (near the top right corner of the right panel), then select
\[dq]External\[dq] and click on \[dq]CREATE\[dq]; on the next screen,
enter an \[dq]Application name\[dq] (\[dq]rclone\[dq] is OK); enter
\[dq]User Support Email\[dq] (your own email is OK); enter
\[dq]Developer Contact Email\[dq] (your own email is OK); then click on
\[dq]Save\[dq] (all other data is optional).
Click again on \[dq]Credentials\[dq] on the left panel to go back to the
\[dq]Credentials\[dq] screen.
.PP
(PS: if you are a GSuite user, you could also select \[dq]Internal\[dq]
instead of \[dq]External\[dq] above, but this has not been
tested/documented so far).
.IP " 6." 4
Click on the \[dq]+ CREATE CREDENTIALS\[dq] button at the top of the
screen, then select \[dq]OAuth client ID\[dq].
.IP " 7." 4
Choose an application type of \[dq]Desktop app\[dq] and click
\[dq]Create\[dq].
(the default name is fine)
.IP " 8." 4
It will show you a client ID and client secret.
Make a note of these.
.IP " 9." 4
Go to \[dq]Oauth consent screen\[dq] and press \[dq]Publish App\[dq]
.IP "10." 4
Provide the noted client ID and client secret to rclone.
.IP "11." 4
Click \[dq]OAuth consent screen\[dq], then click \[dq]PUBLISH APP\[dq]
button and confirm, or add your account under \[dq]Test users\[dq].
.PP
Be aware that, due to the \[dq]enhanced security\[dq] recently
introduced by Google, you are theoretically expected to \[dq]submit your
app for verification\[dq] and then wait a few weeks(!) for their
response; in practice, you can go right ahead and use the client ID and
client secret with rclone, the only issue will be a very scary
confirmation screen shown when you connect via your browser for rclone
to be able to get its token-id (but as this only happens during the
remote configuration, it\[aq]s not such a big deal).

Sometimes, creation of an OAuth consent in Google API Console fails due
to an error message \[lq]The request failed because changes to one of
the field of the resource is not supported\[rq].
As a convenient workaround, the necessary Google Drive API key can be
created on the Python
Quickstart (https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python)
page.
Just push the Enable the Drive API button to receive the Client ID and
Secret.
Note that it will automatically create a new project in the API Console.
.SH Google Photos
.PP
The rclone backend for Google
Photos (https://www.google.com/photos/about/) is a specialized backend
for transferring photos and videos to and from Google Photos.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] The Google Photos API which rclone uses has quite a few
limitations, so please read the limitations section carefully to make
sure it is suitable for your use.
.SS Configuration
.PP
The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from
Google Photos which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 rclone config
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use manual
mode.
.PP
This remote is called \f[C]remote\f[R] and can now be used like this
.PP
See all the albums in your photos
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:album
\f[R]

.PP

\f[C]
rclone sync -i /home/local/image remote:album/newAlbum
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Layout
.PP
As Google Photos is not a general purpose cloud storage system the
backend is laid out to help you navigate it.
.PP
The directories under \f[C]media\f[R] show different ways of
categorizing the media.
Each file will appear multiple times.
So if you want to make a backup of your google photos you might choose
to backup \f[C]remote:media/by-month\f[R].
(\f[B]NB\f[R] \f[C]remote:media/by-day\f[R] is rather slow at the moment
so avoid for syncing.)
.PP
Note that all your photos and videos will appear somewhere under
\f[C]media\f[R], but they may not appear under \f[C]album\f[R] unless
you\[aq]ve put them into albums.

\f[R]
.fi
.PP
There are two writable parts of the tree, the \f[C]upload\f[R] directory
and sub directories of the \f[C]album\f[R] directory.
.PP
The \f[C]upload\f[R] directory is for uploading files you don\[aq]t want
to put into albums.
This will be empty to start with and will contain the files you\[aq]ve
uploaded for one rclone session only, becoming empty again when you
restart rclone.
The use case for this would be if you have a load of files you just want
to once off dump into Google Photos.
For repeated syncing, uploading to \f[C]album\f[R] will work better.
.PP
Directories within the \f[C]album\f[R] directory are also writeable and
you may create new directories (albums) under \f[C]album\f[R].
If you copy files with a directory hierarchy in there then rclone will
create albums with the \f[C]/\f[R] character in them.
For example if you do
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /path/to/images remote:album/images
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and the images directory contains
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
images
    - file1.jpg
    dir
        file2.jpg
    dir2
        dir3
            file3.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then rclone will create the following albums with the following files in
.IP \[bu] 2
images
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
file1.jpg
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
images/dir
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
file2.jpg
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
images/dir2/dir3
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
file3.jpg
.RE
.PP
This means that you can use the \f[C]album\f[R] path pretty much like a
normal filesystem and it is a good target for repeated syncing.
.PP
The \f[C]shared-album\f[R] directory shows albums shared with you or by
you.
This is similar to the Sharing tab in the Google Photos web interface.

.SS --gphotos-read-size
.PP
Set to read the size of media items.
.PP
Normally rclone does not read the size of media items since this takes
another transaction.
This isn\[aq]t necessary for syncing.
However rclone mount needs to know the size of files in advance of
reading them, so setting this flag when using rclone mount is
recommended if you want to read the media.

By default, rclone does not request archived media.
Thus, when syncing, archived media is not visible in directory listings
or transferred.
.PP
Note that media in albums is always visible and synced, no matter their
archive status.
.PP
With this flag, archived media are always visible in directory listings
and transferred.

Without this flag, archived media will not be visible in directory
listings and won\[aq]t be transferred.

.SS Limitations
.PP
Only images and videos can be uploaded.
If you attempt to upload non videos or images or formats that Google
Photos doesn\[aq]t understand, rclone will upload the file, then Google
Photos will give an error when it is put turned into a media item.
.PP
Note that all media items uploaded to Google Photos through the API are
stored in full resolution at \[dq]original quality\[dq] and
\f[B]will\f[R] count towards your storage quota in your Google Account.
The API does \f[B]not\f[R] offer a way to upload in \[dq]high
quality\[dq] mode..
.PP
\f[C]rclone about\f[R] is not supported by the Google Photos backend.
Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount or use policy \f[C]mfs\f[R] (most free space) as a member
of an rclone union remote.
.PP
See List of backends that do not support rclone
about (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) See rclone
about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
.SS Downloading Images
.PP
When Images are downloaded this strips EXIF location (according to the
docs and my tests).
This is a limitation of the Google Photos API and is covered by bug
#112096115 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/112096115).
.PP
\f[B]The current google API does not allow photos to be downloaded at
original resolution. This is very important if you are, for example,
relying on \[dq]Google Photos\[dq] as a backup of your photos. You will
not be able to use rclone to redownload original images. You could use
\[aq]google takeout\[aq] to recover the original photos as a last
resort\f[R]
.SS Downloading Videos
.PP
When videos are downloaded they are downloaded in a really compressed
version of the video compared to downloading it via the Google Photos
web interface.
This is covered by bug
#113672044 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/113672044).
.SS Duplicates
.PP
If a file name is duplicated in a directory then rclone will add the
file ID into its name.
So two files called \f[C]file.jpg\f[R] would then appear as
\f[C]file {123456}.jpg\f[R] and \f[C]file {ABCDEF}.jpg\f[R] (the actual
IDs are a lot longer alas!).
.PP
If you upload the same image (with the same binary data) twice then
Google Photos will deduplicate it.
However it will retain the filename from the first upload which may
confuse rclone.
For example if you uploaded an image to \f[C]upload\f[R] then uploaded
the same image to \f[C]album/my_album\f[R] the filename of the image in
\f[C]album/my_album\f[R] will be what it was uploaded with initially,
not what you uploaded it with to \f[C]album\f[R].
In practise this shouldn\[aq]t cause too many problems.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The date shown of media in Google Photos is the creation date as
determined by the EXIF information, or the upload date if that is not
known.
.PP
This is not changeable by rclone and is not the modification date of the
media on local disk.
This means that rclone cannot use the dates from Google Photos for
syncing purposes.
.SS Size
.PP
The Google Photos API does not return the size of media.
This means that when syncing to Google Photos, rclone can only do a file
existence check.
.PP
It is possible to read the size of the media, but this needs an extra
HTTP HEAD request per media item so is \f[B]very slow\f[R] and uses up a
lot of transactions.
This can be enabled with the \f[C]--gphotos-read-size\f[R] option or the
\f[C]read_size = true\f[R] config parameter.
.PP
If you want to use the backend with \f[C]rclone mount\f[R] you may need
to enable this flag (depending on your OS and application using the
photos) otherwise you may not be able to read media off the mount.
You\[aq]ll need to experiment to see if it works for you without the
flag.
.SS Albums
.PP
Rclone can only upload files to albums it created.
This is a limitation of the Google Photos
API (https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/manage-albums).
.PP
Rclone can remove files it uploaded from albums it created only.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Rclone can remove files from albums it created, but note that the Google
Photos API does not allow media to be deleted permanently so this media
will still remain.
See bug #109759781 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109759781).
.PP
Rclone cannot delete files anywhere except under \f[C]album\f[R].
.SS Deleting albums
.PP
The Google Photos API does not support deleting albums - see bug
#135714733 (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/135714733).
.SH Hasher (EXPERIMENTAL)
.PP
Hasher is a special overlay backend to create remotes which handle
checksums for other remotes.
It\[aq]s main functions include: - Emulate hash types unimplemented by
backends - Cache checksums to help with slow hashing of large local or
(S)FTP files - Warm up checksum cache from external SUM files
.SS Getting started
.PP
To use Hasher, first set up the underlying remote following the
configuration instructions for that remote.
You can also use a local pathname instead of a remote.
Check that your base remote is working.
.PP
Let\[aq]s call the base remote \f[C]myRemote:path\f[R] here.
Note that anything inside \f[C]myRemote:path\f[R] will be handled by
hasher and anything outside won\[aq]t.
This means that if you are using a bucket based remote (S3, B2, Swift)
then you should put the bucket in the remote \f[C]s3:bucket\f[R].
.PP
Now proceed to interactive or manual configuration.
.SS Interactive configuration
.PP
Run \f[C]rclone config\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> Hasher1
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Handle checksums for other remotes
   \[rs] \[dq]hasher\[dq]
[snip]
Storage> hasher
Remote to cache checksums for, like myremote:mypath.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\[dq]\[dq]).
remote> myRemote:path
Comma separated list of supported checksum types.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\[dq]md5,sha1\[dq]).
hashsums> md5
Maximum time to keep checksums in cache. 0 = no cache, off = cache forever.
max_age> off
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
Remote config
--------------------
[Hasher1]
type = hasher
remote = myRemote:path
hashsums = md5
max_age = off
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Manual configuration
.PP
Run \f[C]rclone config path\f[R] to see the path of current active
config file, usually \f[C]YOURHOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R].
Open it in your favorite text editor, find section for the base remote
and create new section for hasher like in the following examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[Hasher1]
type = hasher
remote = myRemote:path
hashes = md5
max_age = off

[Hasher2]
type = hasher
remote = /local/path
hashes = dropbox,sha1
max_age = 24h
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Hasher takes basically the following parameters: - \f[C]remote\f[R] is
required, - \f[C]hashes\f[R] is a comma separated list of supported
checksums (by default \f[C]md5,sha1\f[R]), - \f[C]max_age\f[R] - maximum
time to keep a checksum value in the cache, \f[C]0\f[R] will disable
caching completely, \f[C]off\f[R] will cache \[dq]forever\[dq] (that is
until the files get changed).
.PP
Make sure the \f[C]remote\f[R] has \f[C]:\f[R] (colon) in.
If you specify the remote without a colon then rclone will use a local
directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of \f[C]/local/path\f[R] then rclone will handle
hashes for that directory.
If you use \f[C]remote = name\f[R] literally then rclone will put files
\f[B]in a directory called \f[CB]name\f[B] located under current
directory\f[R].
.SS Usage
.SS Basic operations
.PP
Now you can use it as \f[C]Hasher2:subdir/file\f[R] instead of base
remote.
Hasher will transparently update cache with new checksums when a file is
fully read or overwritten, like:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy External:path/file Hasher:dest/path

rclone cat Hasher:path/to/file > /dev/null
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The way to refresh \f[B]all\f[R] cached checksums (even unsupported by
the base backend) for a subtree is to \f[B]re-download\f[R] all files in
the subtree.
For example, use \f[C]hashsum --download\f[R] using \f[B]any\f[R]
supported hashsum on the command line (we just care to re-read):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone hashsum MD5 --download Hasher:path/to/subtree > /dev/null

rclone backend dump Hasher:path/to/subtree
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can print or drop hashsum cache using custom backend commands:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend dump Hasher:dir/subdir

rclone backend drop Hasher:
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Pre-Seed from a SUM File
.PP
Hasher supports two backend commands: generic SUM file \f[C]import\f[R]
and faster but less consistent \f[C]stickyimport\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend import Hasher:dir/subdir SHA1 /path/to/SHA1SUM [--checkers 4]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Instead of SHA1 it can be any hash supported by the remote.
The last argument can point to either a local or an
\f[C]other-remote:path\f[R] text file in SUM format.
The command will parse the SUM file, then walk down the path given by
the first argument, snapshot current fingerprints and fill in the cache
entries correspondingly.
- Paths in the SUM file are treated as relative to
\f[C]hasher:dir/subdir\f[R].
- The command will \f[B]not\f[R] check that supplied values are correct.
You \f[B]must know\f[R] what you are doing.
- This is a one-time action.
The SUM file will not get \[dq]attached\[dq] to the remote.
Cache entries can still be overwritten later, should the object\[aq]s
fingerprint change.
- The tree walk can take long depending on the tree size.
You can increase \f[C]--checkers\f[R] to make it faster.
Or use \f[C]stickyimport\f[R] if you don\[aq]t care about fingerprints
and consistency.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend stickyimport hasher:path/to/data sha1 remote:/path/to/sum.sha1
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]stickyimport\f[R] is similar to \f[C]import\f[R] but works much
faster because it does not need to stat existing files and skips initial
tree walk.
Instead of binding cache entries to file fingerprints it creates
\f[I]sticky\f[R] entries bound to the file name alone ignoring size,
modification time etc.
Such hash entries can be replaced only by \f[C]purge\f[R],
\f[C]delete\f[R], \f[C]backend drop\f[R] or by full re-read/re-write of
the files.

.SS Implementation details (advanced)
.PP
This section explains how various rclone operations work on a hasher
remote.
.PP
\f[B]Disclaimer. This section describes current implementation which can
change in future rclone versions!.\f[R]
.SS Hashsum command
.PP
The \f[C]rclone hashsum\f[R] (or \f[C]md5sum\f[R] or \f[C]sha1sum\f[R])
command will:
.IP "1." 3
if requested hash is supported by lower level, just pass it.
.IP "2." 3
if object size is below \f[C]auto_size\f[R] then download object and
calculate \f[I]requested\f[R] hashes on the fly.
.IP "3." 3
if unsupported and the size is big enough, build object
\f[C]fingerprint\f[R] (including size, modtime if supported, first-found
\f[I]other\f[R] hash if any).
.IP "4." 3
if the strict match is found in cache for the requested remote, return
the stored hash.
.IP "5." 3
if remote found but fingerprint mismatched, then purge the entry and
proceed to step 6.
.IP "6." 3
if remote not found or had no requested hash type or after step 5:
download object, calculate all \f[I]supported\f[R] hashes on the fly and
store in cache; return requested hash.
.SS Other operations
.IP \[bu] 2
whenever a file is uploaded or downloaded \f[B]in full\f[R], capture the
stream to calculate all supported hashes on the fly and update database
.IP \[bu] 2
server-side \f[C]move\f[R] will update keys of existing cache entries
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]deletefile\f[R] will remove a single cache entry
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]purge\f[R] will remove all cache entries under the purged path
.PP
Note that setting \f[C]max_age = 0\f[R] will disable checksum caching
completely.
.PP
If you set \f[C]max_age = off\f[R], checksums in cache will never age,
unless you fully rewrite or delete the file.
.SS Cache storage
.PP
Cached checksums are stored as \f[C]bolt\f[R] database files under
rclone cache directory, usually \f[C]\[ti]/.cache/rclone/kv/\f[R].
Databases are maintained one per \f[I]base\f[R] backend, named like
\f[C]BaseRemote\[ti]hasher.bolt\f[R].
Checksums for multiple \f[C]alias\f[R]-es into a single base backend
will be stored in the single database.
All local paths are treated as aliases into the \f[C]local\f[R] backend
(unless crypted or chunked) and stored in
\f[C]\[ti]/.cache/rclone/kv/local\[ti]hasher.bolt\f[R].
Databases can be shared between multiple rclone processes.

.SH HTTP
.PP
The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a webserver.
The webserver should provide file listings which rclone will read and
turn into a remote.
This has been tested with common webservers such as Apache/Nginx/Caddy
and will likely work with file listings from most web servers.
(If it doesn\[aq]t then please file an issue, or send a pull request!)
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:\f[R] or \f[C]remote:path\f[R].
.PP
The \f[C]remote:\f[R] represents the configured url, and any path
following it will be resolved relative to this url, according to the URL
standard.
This means with remote url \f[C]https://beta.rclone.org/branch\f[R] and
path \f[C]fix\f[R], the resolved URL will be
\f[C]https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix\f[R], while with path
\f[C]/fix\f[R] the resolved URL will be
\f[C]https://beta.rclone.org/fix\f[R] as the absolute path is resolved
from the root of the domain.
.PP
If the path following the \f[C]remote:\f[R] ends with \f[C]/\f[R] it
will be assumed to point to a directory.
If the path does not end with \f[C]/\f[R], then a HEAD request is sent
and the response used to decide if it it is treated as a file or a
directory (run with \f[C]-vv\f[R] to see details).
When --http-no-head is specified, a path without ending \f[C]/\f[R] is
always assumed to be a file.
If rclone incorrectly assumes the path is a file, the solution is to
specify the path with ending \f[C]/\f[R].
When you know the path is a directory, ending it with \f[C]/\f[R] is
always better as it avoids the initial HEAD request.
.PP
To just download a single file it is easier to use
copyurl (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyurl/).

.PP
A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference
between files and directories.
If this flag is set, then rclone will treat all files with Content-Type:
text/html as directories and read URLs from them rather than downloading
them.

.PP
Don\[aq]t use HEAD requests.
.PP
HEAD requests are mainly used to find file sizes in dir listing.
If your site is being very slow to load then you can try this option.
Normally rclone does a HEAD request for each potential file in a
directory listing to:
.IP \[bu] 2
find its size
.IP \[bu] 2
check it really exists
.IP \[bu] 2
check to see if it is a directory
.PP
If you set this option, rclone will not do the HEAD request.
This will mean that directory listings are much quicker, but rclone
won\[aq]t have the times or sizes of any files, and some files that
don\[aq]t exist may be in the listing.

.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Hubic.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

.PP
This uses the normal OpenStack Swift mechanism to refresh the Swift API
credentials and ignores the expires field returned by the Hubic API.
.PP
The Swift API doesn\[aq]t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won\[aq]t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.
.SH Jottacloud
.PP
Jottacloud is a cloud storage service provider from a Norwegian company,
using its own datacenters in Norway.
In addition to the official service at
jottacloud.com (https://www.jottacloud.com/), it also provides
white-label solutions to different companies, such as: * Telia * Telia
Cloud (cloud.telia.se) * Telia Sky (sky.telia.no) * Tele2 * Tele2 Cloud
(mittcloud.tele2.se) * Elkj\[/o]p (with subsidiaries): * Elkj\[/o]p
Cloud (cloud.elkjop.no) * Elgiganten Sweden (cloud.elgiganten.se) *
Elgiganten Denmark (cloud.elgiganten.dk) * Giganti Cloud
(cloud.gigantti.fi) * ELKO Clouud (cloud.elko.is)
.PP
Most of the white-label versions are supported by this backend, although
may require different authentication setup - described below.
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.SS Authentication types
.PP
Some of the whitelabel versions uses a different authentication method
than the official service, and you have to choose the correct one when
setting up the remote.
.SS Standard authentication
.PP
To configure Jottacloud you will need to generate a personal security
token in the Jottacloud web interface.
You will the option to do in your account security
settings (https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure) (for whitelabel version
you need to find this page in its web interface).
Note that the web interface may refer to this token as a JottaCli token.
.SS Legacy authentication
.PP
If you are using one of the whitelabel versions (e.g.
from Elkj\[/o]p) you may not have the option to generate a CLI token.
In this case you\[aq]ll have to use the legacy authentication.
To do this select yes when the setup asks for legacy authentication and
enter your username and password.
The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.
.SS Telia Cloud authentication
.PP
Similar to other whitelabel versions Telia Cloud doesn\[aq]t offer the
option of creating a CLI token, and additionally uses a separate
authentication flow where the username is generated internally.
To setup rclone to use Telia Cloud, choose Telia Cloud authentication in
the setup.
The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.
.SS Tele2 Cloud authentication
.PP
As Tele2-Com Hem merger was completed this authentication can be used
for former Com Hem Cloud and Tele2 Cloud customers as no support for
creating a CLI token exists, and additionally uses a separate
authentication flow where the username is generated internally.
To setup rclone to use Tele2 Cloud, choose Tele2 Cloud authentication in
the setup.
The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.
.SS Configuration
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R] with
the default setup.
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your Jottacloud
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
List all the files in your Jottacloud
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To copy a local directory to an Jottacloud directory called backup
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Devices and Mountpoints
.PP
The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you
install it on, and then creates a mountpoint for each folder you select
for Backup.
The web interface uses a special device called Jotta for the Archive and
Sync mountpoints.
.PP
With rclone you\[aq]ll want to use the Jotta/Archive device/mountpoint
in most cases, however if you want to access files uploaded by any of
the official clients rclone provides the option to select other devices
and mountpoints during config.
Note that uploading files is currently not supported to other devices
than Jotta.
.PP
The built-in Jotta device may also contain several other mountpoints,
such as: Latest, Links, Shared and Trash.
These are special mountpoints with a different internal representation
than the \[dq]regular\[dq] mountpoints.
Rclone will only to a very limited degree support them.
Generally you should avoid these, unless you know what you are doing.
.SS --fast-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.PP
Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single API
request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could lead to
long wait time before the first results are shown.
.PP
Note also that with rclone version 1.58 and newer information about MIME
types (https://rclone.org/overview/#mime-type) are not available when
using \f[C]--fast-list\f[R].
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the
\f[C]--checksum\f[R] flag.
.PP
Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the
source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached
temporarily on disk (in location given by
--temp-dir (https://rclone.org/docs/#temp-dir-dir)) before it is
uploaded.
Small files will be cached in memory - see the
--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit flag.
When uploading from local disk the source checksum is always available,
so this does not apply.
Starting with rclone version 1.52 the same is true for crypted remotes
(in older versions the crypt backend would not calculate hashes for
uploads from local disk, so the Jottacloud backend had to do it as
described above).
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:
.PP

.TE
.PP
Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be used in XML strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
By default, rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
They will be permanently deleted automatically after 30 days.
You may bypass the trash and permanently delete files immediately by
using the --jottacloud-hard-delete flag, or set the equivalent
environment variable.
Emptying the trash is supported by the
cleanup (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cleanup/) command.
.SS Versions
.PP
Jottacloud supports file versioning.
When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of
it.
Currently rclone only supports retrieving the current version but older
versions can be accessed via the Jottacloud Website.
.PP
Versioning can be disabled by \f[C]--jottacloud-no-versions\f[R] option.
This is achieved by deleting the remote file prior to uploading a new
version.
If the upload the fails no version of the file will be available in the
remote.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone about remote:\f[R] command which will display your usage
limit (unless it is unlimited) and the current usage.
.SS Advanced options
.PP
Here are the advanced options specific to jottacloud (Jottacloud).

.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file
called \[dq]Hello.doc\[dq] and one called \[dq]hello.doc\[dq].
.PP
There are quite a few characters that can\[aq]t be in Jottacloud file
names.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent.
For example if a file has a ?
in it will be mapped to \[uFF1F] instead.
.PP
Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.
.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files
and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove operations to
previously deleted paths to fail.
Emptying the trash should help in such cases.
.SH Koofr
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.SS Configuration
.PP
The initial setup for Koofr involves creating an application password
for rclone.
You can do that by opening the Koofr web
application (https://app.koofr.net/app/admin/preferences/password),
giving the password a nice name like \f[C]rclone\f[R] and clicking on
generate.

.SH Mail.ru Cloud
.PP
Mail.ru Cloud (https://cloud.mail.ru/) is a cloud storage provided by a
Russian internet company Mail.Ru Group (https://mail.ru).
The official desktop client is Disk-O: (https://disk-o.cloud/en),
available on Windows and Mac OS.
.PP
Currently it is recommended to disable 2FA on Mail.ru accounts intended
for rclone until it gets eventually implemented.
.SS Features highlights
.IP \[bu] 2
Paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Files have a \f[C]last modified time\f[R] property, directories
don\[aq]t
.IP \[bu] 2
Deleted files are by default moved to the trash
.IP \[bu] 2
Files and directories can be shared via public links
.IP \[bu] 2
Partial uploads or streaming are not supported, file size must be known
before upload
.IP \[bu] 2
Maximum file size is limited to 2G for a free account, unlimited for
paid accounts
.IP \[bu] 2
Storage keeps hash for all files and performs transparent deduplication,
the hash algorithm is a modified SHA1
.IP \[bu] 2
If a particular file is already present in storage, one can quickly
submit file hash instead of long file upload (this optimization is
supported by rclone)

.SS Modified time
.PP
Files support a modification time attribute with up to 1 second
precision.
Directories do not have a modification time, which is shown as \[dq]Jan
1 1970\[dq].
.SS Hash checksums
.PP
Hash sums use a custom Mail.ru algorithm based on SHA1.
If file size is less than or equal to the SHA1 block size (20 bytes),
its hash is simply its data right-padded with zero bytes.
Hash sum of a larger file is computed as a SHA1 sum of the file data
bytes concatenated with a decimal representation of the data length.
.SS Emptying Trash
.PP
Removing a file or directory actually moves it to the trash, which is
not visible to rclone but can be seen in a web browser.
The trashed file still occupies part of total quota.
If you wish to empty your trash and free some quota, you can use the
\f[C]rclone cleanup remote:\f[R] command, which will permanently delete
all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.
.SS Quota information
.PP
To view your current quota you can use the
\f[C]rclone about remote:\f[R] command which will display your usage
limit (quota) and the current usage.

It is meaningless and ineffective if source file is unique or encrypted.
Please note that rclone may need local memory and disk space to
calculate content hash in advance and decide whether full upload is
required.

.SH Mega
.PP
Mega (https://mega.nz/) is a cloud storage and file hosting service
known for its security feature where all files are encrypted locally
before they are uploaded.
This prevents anyone (including employees of Mega) from accessing the
files without knowledge of the key used for encryption.
.PP
This is an rclone backend for Mega which supports the file transfer
features of Mega using the same client side encryption.
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be

.SS Duplicated files
.PP
Mega can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a
normal file system).
.PP
Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.
.PP
Use \f[C]rclone dedupe\f[R] to fix duplicated files.
.SS Failure to log-in
.PP
Mega remotes seem to get blocked (reject logins) under \[dq]heavy
use\[dq].
We haven\[aq]t worked out the exact blocking rules but it seems to be
related to fast paced, successive rclone commands.
.PP
For example, executing this command 90 times in a row
\f[C]rclone link remote:file\f[R] will cause the remote to become
\[dq]blocked\[dq].
This is not an abnormal situation, for example if you wish to get the
public links of a directory with hundred of files...
After more or less a week, the remote will remote accept rclone logins
normally again.
.PP
You can mitigate this issue by mounting the remote it with
\f[C]rclone mount\f[R].
This will log-in when mounting and a log-out when unmounting only.
You can also run \f[C]rclone rcd\f[R] and then use \f[C]rclone rc\f[R]
to run the commands over the API to avoid logging in each time.
.PP
Rclone does not currently close mega sessions (you can see them in the
web interface), however closing the sessions does not solve the issue.
.PP
If you space rclone commands by 3 seconds it will avoid blocking the
remote.
We haven\[aq]t identified the exact blocking rules, so perhaps one could
execute the command 80 times without waiting and avoid blocking by
waiting 3 seconds, then continuing...
.PP
Note that this has been observed by trial and error and might not be set
in stone.
.PP
Other tools seem not to produce this blocking effect, as they use a
different working approach (state-based, using sessionIDs instead of
log-in) which isn\[aq]t compatible with the current stateless rclone
approach.
.PP
Note that once blocked, the use of other tools (such as megacmd) is not
a sure workaround: following megacmd login times have been observed in
succession for blocked remote: 7 minutes, 20 min, 30min, 30 min, 30min.
Web access looks unaffected though.
.PP
Investigation is continuing in relation to workarounds based on
timeouts, pacers, retrials and tpslimits - if you discover something
relevant, please post on the forum.
.PP
So, if rclone was working nicely and suddenly you are unable to log-in
and you are sure the user and the password are correct, likely you have
got the remote blocked for a while.

.SS Limitations
.PP
This backend uses the go-mega go
library (https://github.com/t3rm1n4l/go-mega) which is an opensource go
library implementing the Mega API.
There doesn\[aq]t appear to be any documentation for the mega protocol
beyond the mega C++ SDK (https://github.com/meganz/sdk) source code so
there are likely quite a few errors still remaining in this library.
.PP
Mega allows duplicate files which may confuse rclone.
.SH Memory
.PP
The memory backend is an in RAM backend.
It does not persist its data - use the local backend for that.

Because the memory backend isn\[aq]t persistent it is most useful for
testing or with an rclone server or rclone mount, e.g.

\f[C]
rclone mount :memory: /mnt/tmp
rclone serve webdav :memory:
rclone serve sftp :memory:

.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
The memory backend supports MD5 hashes and modification times accurate
to 1 nS.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
The memory backend replaces the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters).
.SH Akamai NetStorage
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:\f[R] You may put subdirectories in
too, e.g.
\f[C]remote:/path/to/dir\f[R].
If you have a CP code you can use that as the folder after the domain
such as <domain>/<cpcode>/<internal directories within cpcode>.
.PP
For example, this is commonly configured with or without a CP code: *
\f[B]With a CP code\f[R].
\f[C][your-domain-prefix]-nsu.akamaihd.net/123456/subdirectory/\f[R] *
\f[B]Without a CP code\f[R].
\f[C][your-domain-prefix]-nsu.akamaihd.net\f[R]
.PP
See all buckets rclone lsd remote: The initial setup for Netstorage

.SS Features
.SS Symlink Support
.PP
The Netstorage backend changes the rclone \f[C]--links, -l\f[R]
behavior.
When uploading, instead of creating the .rclonelink file, use the
\[dq]symlink\[dq] API in order to create the corresponding symlink on
the remote.
The .rclonelink file will not be created, the upload will be intercepted
and only the symlink file that matches the source file name with no
suffix will be created on the remote.
.PP
This will effectively allow commands like copy/copyto, move/moveto and
sync to upload from local to remote and download from remote to local
directories with symlinks.
Due to internal rclone limitations, it is not possible to upload an
individual symlink file to any remote backend.
You can always use the \[dq]backend symlink\[dq] command to create a
symlink on the NetStorage server, refer to \[dq]symlink\[dq] section
below.
.PP
Individual symlink files on the remote can be used with the commands
like \[dq]cat\[dq] to print the destination name, or \[dq]delete\[dq] to
delete symlink, or copy, copy/to and move/moveto to download from the
remote to local.
Note: individual symlink files on the remote should be specified
including the suffix .rclonelink.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: No file with the suffix .rclonelink should ever exist on
the server since it is not possible to actually upload/create a file
with .rclonelink suffix with rclone, it can only exist if it is manually
created through a non-rclone method on the remote.
.SS Implicit vs. Explicit Directories
.PP
With NetStorage, directories can exist in one of two forms:
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]Explicit Directory\f[R].
This is an actual, physical directory that you have created in a storage
group.
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]Implicit Directory\f[R].
This refers to a directory within a path that has not been physically
created.
For example, during upload of a file, non-existent subdirectories can be
specified in the target path.
NetStorage creates these as \[dq]implicit.\[dq] While the directories
aren\[aq]t physically created, they exist implicitly and the noted path
is connected with the uploaded file.
.PP
Rclone will intercept all file uploads and mkdir commands for the
NetStorage remote and will explicitly issue the mkdir command for each
directory in the uploading path.
This will help with the interoperability with the other Akamai services
such as SFTP and the Content Management Shell (CMShell).
Rclone will not guarantee correctness of operations with implicit
directories which might have been created as a result of using an upload
API directly.
.SS \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] / ListR support
.PP
NetStorage remote supports the ListR feature by using the \[dq]list\[dq]
NetStorage API action to return a lexicographical list of all objects
within the specified CP code, recursing into subdirectories as
they\[aq]re encountered.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Rclone will use the ListR method for some commands by default\f[R].
Commands such as \f[C]lsf -R\f[R] will use ListR by default.
To disable this, include the \f[C]--disable listR\f[R] option to use the
non-recursive method of listing objects.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Rclone will not use the ListR method for some commands\f[R].
Commands such as \f[C]sync\f[R] don\[aq]t use ListR by default.
To force using the ListR method, include the \f[C]--fast-list\f[R]
option.
.PP
There are pros and cons of using the ListR method, refer to rclone
documentation (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list).
In general, the sync command over an existing deep tree on the remote
will run faster with the \[dq]--fast-list\[dq] flag but with extra
memory usage as a side effect.
It might also result in higher CPU utilization but the whole task can be
completed faster.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: There is a known limitation that \[dq]lsf -R\[dq] will
display number of files in the directory and directory size as -1 when
ListR method is used.
The workaround is to pass \[dq]--disable listR\[dq] flag if these
numbers are important in the output.
.SS Purge
.PP
NetStorage remote supports the purge feature by using the
\[dq]quick-delete\[dq] NetStorage API action.
The quick-delete action is disabled by default for security reasons and
can be enabled for the account through the Akamai portal.
Rclone will first try to use quick-delete action for the purge command
and if this functionality is disabled then will fall back to a standard
delete method.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R]: Read the NetStorage Usage
API (https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/webhelp/netstorage/netstorage-http-api-developer-guide/GUID-15836617-9F50-405A-833C-EA2556756A30.html)
for considerations when using \[dq]quick-delete\[dq].
In general, using quick-delete method will not delete the tree
immediately and objects targeted for quick-delete may still be
accessible.

\f[R]
.fi
.SS --fast-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object with the
\f[C]mtime\f[R] key.
It is stored using RFC3339 Format time with nanosecond precision.
The metadata is supplied during directory listings so there is no
overhead to using it.
.SS Performance
.PP
When uploading large files, increasing the value of
\f[C]--azureblob-upload-concurrency\f[R] will increase performance at
the cost of using more memory.
The default of 16 is set quite conservatively to use less memory.
It maybe be necessary raise it to 64 or higher to fully utilize a 1
GBit/s link with a single file transfer.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:
.PP

.PP
Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.SS Hashes
.PP
MD5 hashes are stored with blobs.
However blobs that were uploaded in chunks only have an MD5 if the
source remote was capable of MD5 hashes, e.g.
the local disk.
.SS Authenticating with Azure Blob Storage
.PP
Rclone has 3 ways of authenticating with Azure Blob Storage:
.SS Account and Key
.PP
This is the most straight forward and least flexible way.
Just fill in the \f[C]account\f[R] and \f[C]key\f[R] lines and leave the
rest blank.
.SS SAS URL
.PP
This can be an account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL.
.PP
To use it leave \f[C]account\f[R], \f[C]key\f[R] blank and fill in
\f[C]sas_url\f[R].
.PP
An account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL can be obtained from
the Azure portal or the Azure Storage Explorer.
To get a container level SAS URL right click on a container in the Azure
Blob explorer in the Azure portal.
.PP
If you use a container level SAS URL, rclone operations are permitted
only on a particular container, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls azureblob:container
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You can also list the single container from the root.
This will only show the container specified by the SAS URL.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone lsd azureblob:
container/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that you can\[aq]t see or access any other containers - this will
fail
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls azureblob:othercontainer
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Container level SAS URLs are useful for temporarily allowing third
parties access to a single container or putting credentials into an
untrusted environment such as a CI build server.

.SS --azureblob-upload-concurrency
.PP
Concurrency for multipart uploads.
.PP
This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.
.PP
If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.
.PP
In tests, upload speed increases almost linearly with upload
concurrency.
For example to fill a gigabit pipe it may be necessary to raise this to
64.
Note that this will use more memory.

account level
.PP
If there is no \[dq]access tier\[dq] specified, rclone doesn\[aq]t apply
any tier.
rclone performs \[dq]Set Tier\[dq] operation on blobs while uploading,
if objects are not modified, specifying \[dq]access tier\[dq] to new one
will have no effect.
If blobs are in \[dq]archive tier\[dq] at remote, trying to perform data
transfer operations from remote will not be allowed.

then rclone will produce the error:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
can\[aq]t update archive tier blob without --azureblob-archive-tier-delete
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
With this flag set then before rclone attempts to overwrite an archive
tier blob, it will delete the existing blob before uploading its
replacement.
This has the potential for data loss if the upload fails (unlike
updating a normal blob) and also may cost more since deleting archive
tier blobs early may be chargable.

See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your OneDrive
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
List all the files in your OneDrive
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:

.SS Getting your own Client ID and Key
.PP
You can use your own Client ID if the default (\f[C]client_id\f[R] left
blank) one doesn\[aq]t work for you or you see lots of throttling.
The default Client ID and Key is shared by all rclone users when
performing requests.
.PP
If you are having problems with them (E.g., seeing a lot of throttling),
you can get your own Client ID and Key by following the steps below:
.IP "1." 3
Open
https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade
and then click \f[C]New registration\f[R].
.IP "2." 3
Enter a name for your app, choose account type
\f[C]Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)\f[R],
select \f[C]Web\f[R] in \f[C]Redirect URI\f[R], then type (do not copy
and paste) \f[C]http://localhost:53682/\f[R] and click Register.
Copy and keep the \f[C]Application (client) ID\f[R] under the app name
for later use.
.IP "3." 3
Under \f[C]manage\f[R] select \f[C]Certificates & secrets\f[R], click
\f[C]New client secret\f[R].
Enter a description (can be anything) and set \f[C]Expires\f[R] to 24
months.
Copy and keep that secret \f[I]Value\f[R] for later use (you
\f[I]won\[aq]t\f[R] be able to see this value afterwards).
.IP "4." 3
Under \f[C]manage\f[R] select \f[C]API permissions\f[R], click
\f[C]Add a permission\f[R] and select \f[C]Microsoft Graph\f[R] then
select \f[C]delegated permissions\f[R].
.IP "5." 3
Search and select the following permissions: \f[C]Files.Read\f[R],
\f[C]Files.ReadWrite\f[R], \f[C]Files.Read.All\f[R],
\f[C]Files.ReadWrite.All\f[R], \f[C]offline_access\f[R],
\f[C]User.Read\f[R], and optionally \f[C]Sites.Read.All\f[R] (see
below).
Once selected click \f[C]Add permissions\f[R] at the bottom.
.PP
Now the application is complete.
Run \f[C]rclone config\f[R] to create or edit a OneDrive remote.
Supply the app ID and password as Client ID and Secret, respectively.
rclone will walk you through the remaining steps.
.PP
The \f[C]Sites.Read.All\f[R] permission is required if you need to
search SharePoint sites when configuring the
remote (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5883).
However, if that permission is not assigned, you need to set
\f[C]disable_site_permission\f[R] option to true in the advanced
options.
.SS Modification time and hashes
.PP
OneDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
.PP
OneDrive personal supports SHA1 type hashes.
OneDrive for business and Sharepoint Server support
QuickXorHash (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash).
.PP
For all types of OneDrive you can use the \f[C]--checksum\f[R] flag.

be used in JSON strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Microsoft doesn\[aq]t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft\[aq]s
apps or via the OneDrive website.

.SS Limitations
.PP
If you don\[aq]t use rclone for 90 days the refresh token will expire.
This will result in authorization problems.
This is easy to fix by running the
\f[C]rclone config reconnect remote:\f[R] command to get a new token and
refresh token.
.SS Naming
.PP
Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file
called \[dq]Hello.doc\[dq] and one called \[dq]hello.doc\[dq].
.PP
There are quite a few characters that can\[aq]t be in OneDrive file
names.
These can\[aq]t occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows platforms
they are common.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent.
For example if a file has a \f[C]?\f[R] in it will be mapped to
\f[C]\[uFF1F]\f[R] instead.
.SS File sizes
.PP
The largest allowed file size is 250 GiB for both OneDrive Personal and
OneDrive for Business (Updated 13 Jan
2021) (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us#individualfilesize).
.SS Path length
.PP
The entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 400
characters for OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online.
If you are encrypting file and folder names with rclone, you may want to
pay attention to this limitation because the encrypted names are
typically longer than the original ones.
.SS Number of files
.PP
OneDrive seems to be OK with at least 50,000 files in a folder, but at
100,000 rclone will get errors listing the directory like
\f[C]couldn\[cq]t list files: UnknownError:\f[R].
See #2707 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2707) for more info.
.PP
An official document about the limitations for different types of
OneDrive can be found
here (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-onedrive-for-business-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa).
.SS Versions
.PP
Every change in a file OneDrive causes the service to create a new
version of the the file.
This counts against a users quota.
For example changing the modification time of a file creates a second
version, so the file apparently uses twice the space.
.PP
For example the \f[C]copy\f[R] command is affected by this as rclone
copies the file and then afterwards sets the modification time to match
the source file which uses another version.
.PP
You can use the \f[C]rclone cleanup\f[R] command (see below) to remove
all old versions.
.PP
Or you can set the \f[C]no_versions\f[R] parameter to \f[C]true\f[R] and
rclone will remove versions after operations which create new versions.
This takes extra transactions so only enable it if you need it.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R] At the time of writing Onedrive Personal creates versions
(but not for setting the modification time) but the API for removing
them returns \[dq]API not found\[dq] so cleanup and
\f[C]no_versions\f[R] should not be used on Onedrive Personal.
.SS Disabling versioning
.PP
Starting October 2018, users will no longer be able to disable
versioning by default.
This is because Microsoft has brought an
update (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-OneDrive-Blog/New-Updates-to-OneDrive-and-SharePoint-Team-Site-Versioning/ba-p/204390)
to the mechanism.
To change this new default setting, a PowerShell command is required to
be run by a SharePoint admin.
If you are an admin, you can run these commands in PowerShell to change
that setting:
.IP "1." 3
\f[C]Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell\f[R]
(in case you haven\[aq]t installed this already)
.IP "2." 3
\f[C]Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking\f[R]
.IP "3." 3
\f[C]Connect-SPOService -Url https://YOURSITE-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential YOU\[at]YOURSITE.COM\f[R]
(replacing \f[C]YOURSITE\f[R], \f[C]YOU\f[R], \f[C]YOURSITE.COM\f[R]
with the actual values; this will prompt for your credentials)
.IP "4." 3
\f[C]Set-SPOTenant -EnableMinimumVersionRequirement $False\f[R]
.IP "5." 3
\f[C]Disconnect-SPOService\f[R] (to disconnect from the server)
.PP
\f[I]Below are the steps for normal users to disable versioning. If you
don\[aq]t see the \[dq]No Versioning\[dq] option, make sure the above
requirements are met.\f[R]
.PP
User Weropol (https://github.com/Weropol) has found a method to disable
versioning on OneDrive
.IP "1." 3
Open the settings menu by clicking on the gear symbol at the top of the
OneDrive Business page.
.IP "2." 3
Click Site settings.
.IP "3." 3
Once on the Site settings page, navigate to Site Administration > Site
libraries and lists.
.IP "4." 3
Click Customize \[dq]Documents\[dq].
.IP "5." 3
Click General Settings > Versioning Settings.
.IP "6." 3
Under Document Version History select the option No versioning.
Note: This will disable the creation of new file versions, but will not
remove any previous versions.
Your documents are safe.
.IP "7." 3
Apply the changes by clicking OK.
.IP "8." 3
Use rclone to upload or modify files.
(I also use the --no-update-modtime flag)
.IP "9." 3
Restore the versioning settings after using rclone.
(Optional)
.SS Cleanup
.PP
OneDrive supports \f[C]rclone cleanup\f[R] which causes rclone to look
through every file under the path supplied and delete all version but
the current version.
Because this involves traversing all the files, then querying each file
for versions it can be quite slow.
Rclone does \f[C]--checkers\f[R] tests in parallel.
The command also supports \f[C]-i\f[R] which is a great way to see what
it would do.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone cleanup -i remote:path/subdir # interactively remove all old version for path/subdir
rclone cleanup remote:path/subdir    # unconditionally remove all old version for path/subdir
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] Onedrive personal can\[aq]t currently delete versions
.SS Troubleshooting
.SS Excessive throttling or blocked on SharePoint
.PP
If you experience excessive throttling or is being blocked on SharePoint
then it may help to set the user agent explicitly with a flag like this:
\f[C]--user-agent \[dq]ISV|rclone.org|rclone/v1.55.1\[dq]\f[R]
.PP
The specific details can be found in the Microsoft document: Avoid
getting throttled or blocked in SharePoint
Online (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/how-to-avoid-getting-throttled-or-blocked-in-sharepoint-online#how-to-decorate-your-http-traffic-to-avoid-throttling)
.SS Unexpected file size/hash differences on Sharepoint
.PP
It is a
known (https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/935#issuecomment-441741631)
issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) silently
modifies uploaded files, mainly Office files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.),
causing file size and hash checks to fail.
There are also other situations that will cause OneDrive to report
inconsistent file sizes.
To use rclone with such affected files on Sharepoint, you may disable
these checks with the following command line arguments:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--ignore-checksum --ignore-size
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Alternatively, if you have write access to the OneDrive files, it may be
possible to fix this problem for certain files, by attempting the steps
below.
Open the web interface for OneDrive (https://onedrive.live.com) and find
the affected files (which will be in the error messages/log for rclone).
Simply click on each of these files, causing OneDrive to open them on
the web.
This will cause each file to be converted in place to a format that is
functionally equivalent but which will no longer trigger the size
discrepancy.
Once all problematic files are converted you will no longer need the
ignore options above.
.SS Replacing/deleting existing files on Sharepoint gets \[dq]item not found\[dq]
.PP
It is a
known (https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/1068) issue
that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) may return
\[dq]item not found\[dq] errors when users try to replace or delete
uploaded files; this seems to mainly affect Office files (.docx, .xlsx,
etc.) and web files (.html, .aspx, etc.).
As a workaround, you may use the \f[C]--backup-dir <BACKUP_DIR>\f[R]
command line argument so rclone moves the files to be replaced/deleted
into a given backup directory (instead of directly replacing/deleting
them).
For example, to instruct rclone to move the files into the directory
\f[C]rclone-backup-dir\f[R] on backend \f[C]mysharepoint\f[R], you may
use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--backup-dir mysharepoint:rclone-backup-dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS access_denied (AADSTS65005)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Error: access_denied
Code: AADSTS65005
Description: Using application \[aq]rclone\[aq] is currently not supported for your organization [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] because it is in an unmanaged state. An administrator needs to claim ownership of the company by DNS validation of [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] before the application rclone can be provisioned.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This means that rclone can\[aq]t use the OneDrive for Business API with
your account.
You can\[aq]t do much about it, maybe write an email to your admins.
.PP
However, there are other ways to interact with your OneDrive account.
Have a look at the webdav backend: https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint
.SS invalid_grant (AADSTS50076)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Error: invalid_grant
Code: AADSTS50076
Description: Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must use multi-factor authentication to access \[aq]...\[aq].
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you see the error above after enabling multi-factor authentication
for your account, you can fix it by refreshing your OAuth refresh token.
To do that, run \f[C]rclone config\f[R], and choose to edit your
OneDrive backend.
Then, you don\[aq]t need to actually make any changes until you reach
this question: \f[C]Already have a token - refresh?\f[R].
For this question, answer \f[C]y\f[R] and go through the process to
refresh your token, just like the first time the backend is configured.
After this, rclone should work again for this backend.
.SS Invalid request when making public links
.PP
On Sharepoint and OneDrive for Business, \f[C]rclone link\f[R] may
return an \[dq]Invalid request\[dq] error.
A possible cause is that the organisation admin didn\[aq]t allow public
links to be made for the organisation/sharepoint library.
To fix the permissions as an admin, take a look at the docs:
1 (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off),
2 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-up-and-manage-access-requests-94b26e0b-2822-49d4-929a-8455698654b3).

.SH Sia
.PP
Sia (sia.tech (https://sia.tech/)) is a decentralized cloud storage
platform based on the blockchain (https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)
technology.
With rclone you can use it like any other remote filesystem or mount Sia
folders locally.
The technology behind it involves a number of new concepts such as
Siacoins and Wallet, Blockchain and Consensus, Renting and Hosting, and
so on.
If you are new to it, you\[aq]d better first familiarize yourself using
their excellent support documentation (https://support.sia.tech/).
.SS Introduction
.PP
Before you can use rclone with Sia, you will need to have a running copy
of \f[C]Sia-UI\f[R] or \f[C]siad\f[R] (the Sia daemon) locally on your
computer or on local network (e.g.
a NAS).
Please follow the Get started (https://sia.tech/get-started) guide and
install one.
.PP
rclone interacts with Sia network by talking to the Sia daemon via HTTP
API (https://sia.tech/docs/) which is usually available on port
\f[I]9980\f[R].
By default you will run the daemon locally on the same computer so
it\[aq]s safe to leave the API password blank (the API URL will be
\f[C]http://127.0.0.1:9980\f[R] making external access impossible).
.PP
However, if you want to access Sia daemon running on another node, for
example due to memory constraints or because you want to share single
daemon between several rclone and Sia-UI instances, you\[aq]ll need to
make a few more provisions: - Ensure you have \f[I]Sia daemon\f[R]
installed directly or in a docker
container (https://github.com/SiaFoundation/siad/pkgs/container/siad)
because Sia-UI does not support this mode natively.
- Run it on externally accessible port, for example provide
\f[C]--api-addr :9980\f[R] and \f[C]--disable-api-security\f[R]
arguments on the daemon command line.
- Enforce API password for the \f[C]siad\f[R] daemon via environment
variable \f[C]SIA_API_PASSWORD\f[R] or text file named
\f[C]apipassword\f[R] in the daemon directory.
- Set rclone backend option \f[C]api_password\f[R] taking it from above
locations.
.PP
Notes: 1.
If your wallet is locked, rclone cannot unlock it automatically.
You should either unlock it in advance by using Sia-UI or via command
line \f[C]siac wallet unlock\f[R].
Alternatively you can make \f[C]siad\f[R] unlock your wallet
automatically upon startup by running it with environment variable
\f[C]SIA_WALLET_PASSWORD\f[R].
2.
If \f[C]siad\f[R] cannot find the \f[C]SIA_API_PASSWORD\f[R] variable or
the \f[C]apipassword\f[R] file in the \f[C]SIA_DIR\f[R] directory, it
will generate a random password and store in the text file named
\f[C]apipassword\f[R] under \f[C]YOUR_HOME/.sia/\f[R] directory on Unix
or
\f[C]C:\[rs]Users\[rs]YOUR_HOME\[rs]AppData\[rs]Local\[rs]Sia\[rs]apipassword\f[R]
on Windows.
Remember this when you configure password in rclone.
3.
The only way to use \f[C]siad\f[R] without API password is to run it
\f[B]on localhost\f[R] with command line argument
\f[C]--authorize-api=false\f[R], but this is insecure and \f[B]strongly
discouraged\f[R].
.SS Configuration
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a \f[C]sia\f[R] remote called
\f[C]mySia\f[R].
First, run:
.IP

.SS Configuration from an OpenStack credentials file
.PP
An OpenStack credentials file typically looks something something like
this (without the comments)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
export OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
export OS_TENANT_NAME=\[dq]1234567890123456\[dq]
export OS_USERNAME=\[dq]123abc567xy\[dq]
echo \[dq]Please enter your OpenStack Password: \[dq]
read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_REGION_NAME=\[dq]SBG1\[dq]
if [ -z \[dq]$OS_REGION_NAME\[dq] ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The config file needs to look something like this where
\f[C]$OS_USERNAME\f[R] represents the value of the \f[C]OS_USERNAME\f[R]
variable - \f[C]123abc567xy\f[R] in the example above.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[remote]
type = swift
user = $OS_USERNAME
key = $OS_PASSWORD
auth = $OS_AUTH_URL
tenant = $OS_TENANT_NAME
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that you may (or may not) need to set \f[C]region\f[R] too - try
without first.
.SS Configuration from the environment
.PP
If you prefer you can configure rclone to use swift using a standard set
of OpenStack environment variables.
.PP
When you run through the config, make sure you choose \f[C]true\f[R] for
\f[C]env_auth\f[R] and leave everything else blank.
.PP
rclone will then set any empty config parameters from the environment
using standard OpenStack environment variables.
There is a list of the
variables (https://godoc.org/github.com/ncw/swift#Connection.ApplyEnvironment)
in the docs for the swift library.
.SS Using an alternate authentication method
.PP
If your OpenStack installation uses a non-standard authentication method
that might not be yet supported by rclone or the underlying swift
library, you can authenticate externally (e.g.
calling manually the \f[C]openstack\f[R] commands to get a token).
Then, you just need to pass the two configuration variables
\f[C]auth_token\f[R] and \f[C]storage_url\f[R].
If they are both provided, the other variables are ignored.
rclone will not try to authenticate but instead assume it is already
authenticated and use these two variables to access the OpenStack
installation.
.SS Using rclone without a config file
.PP
You can use rclone with swift without a config file, if desired, like
this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
source openstack-credentials-file
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=swift
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_ENV_AUTH=true
rclone lsd myremote:
\f[R]
.fi
.SS --fast-list
.PP
This remote supports \f[C]--fast-list\f[R] which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS --update and --use-server-modtime
.PP
As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object.
It is used by default for all operations that require checking the time
a file was last updated.
It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it
is inefficient because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the
metadata.
.PP
For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote
is sufficient to determine if it is \[dq]dirty\[dq].
By using \f[C]--update\f[R] along with \f[C]--use-server-modtime\f[R],
you can avoid the extra API call and simply upload files whose local
modtime is newer than the time it was last uploaded.
.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X-Object-Meta-Mtime\f[R] as floating point since the epoch accurate
to 1 ns.
.PP
This is a de facto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

.SS --swift-chunk-size

Default: 5Gi
.SS --swift-no-chunk
.PP
Don\[aq]t chunk files during streaming upload.
.PP
When doing streaming uploads (e.g.
using rcat or mount) setting this flag will cause the swift backend to
not upload chunked files.
.PP
This will limit the maximum upload size to 5 GiB.
However non chunked files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.
.PP
Rclone will still chunk files bigger than chunk_size when doing normal
copy operations.
.PP
Properties:
.IP \[bu] 2
Config: no_chunk
.IP \[bu] 2
Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_NO_CHUNK
.IP \[bu] 2
Type: bool

.SS --swift-encoding

Config: encoding
.IP \[bu] 2
Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_ENCODING
.IP \[bu] 2
Type: MultiEncoder
.IP \[bu] 2
Default: Slash,InvalidUtf8
.SS Limitations
.PP
The Swift API doesn\[aq]t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won\[aq]t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.
.SS Troubleshooting
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system for \[dq]remote:\[dq]: Bad Request
.PP
Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a \[dq]Bad
Request\[dq] error rather than a more sensible error when the
authentication fails for Swift.
.PP
So this most likely means your username / password is wrong.
You can investigate further with the \f[C]--dump-bodies\f[R] flag.
.PP
This may also be caused by specifying the region when you shouldn\[aq]t
have (e.g.
OVH).
.SS Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn\[aq]t have storage url and auth token
.PP
This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.
.SS OVH Cloud Archive
.PP
To use rclone with OVH cloud archive, first use \f[C]rclone config\f[R]
to set up a \f[C]swift\f[R] backend with OVH, choosing \f[C]pca\f[R] as
the \f[C]storage_policy\f[R].
.SS Uploading Objects
.PP
Uploading objects to OVH cloud archive is no different to object
storage, you just simply run the command you like (move, copy or sync)
to upload the objects.
Once uploaded the objects will show in a \[dq]Frozen\[dq] state within
the OVH control panel.
.SS Retrieving Objects
.PP
To retrieve objects use \f[C]rclone copy\f[R] as normal.
If the objects are in a frozen state then rclone will ask for them all
to be unfrozen and it will wait at the end of the output with a message
like the following:
.PP
\f[C]2019/03/23 13:06:33 NOTICE: Received retry after error - sleeping until 2019-03-23T13:16:33.481657164+01:00 (9m59.99985121s)\f[R]
.PP
Rclone will wait for the time specified then retry the copy.
.SH pCloud
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.SS Configuration
.PP
The initial setup for pCloud involves getting a token from pCloud which
you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 rclone config
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to
set it up on a machine with no Internet browser available.
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from pCloud.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.
.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level of your pCloud
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
List all the files in your pCloud
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To copy a local directory to a pCloud directory called backup
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy /home/source remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
pCloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.
In order to set a Modification time pCloud requires the object be
re-uploaded.
.PP
pCloud supports MD5 and SHA1 hashes in the US region, and SHA1 and
SHA256 hashes in the EU region, so you can use the \f[C]--checksum\f[R]
flag.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
In addition to the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) the following
characters are also replaced:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l c c.
T{

T}@T{

.TE
.PP
Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be used in JSON strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Deleted files will be moved to the trash.
Your subscription level will determine how long items stay in the trash.
\f[C]rclone cleanup\f[R] can be used to empty the trash.
.SS Root folder ID
.PP
You can set the \f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] for rclone.
This is the directory (identified by its \f[C]Folder ID\f[R]) that
rclone considers to be the root of your pCloud drive.
.PP
Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.
.PP
However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.
.PP
In order to do this you will have to find the \f[C]Folder ID\f[R] of the
directory you wish rclone to display.
This will be the \f[C]folder\f[R] field of the URL when you open the
relevant folder in the pCloud web interface.
.PP
So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
\f[C]https://my.pcloud.com/#page=filemanager&folder=5xxxxxxxx8&tpl=foldergrid\f[R]
in the browser, then you use \f[C]5xxxxxxxx8\f[R] as the
\f[C]root_folder_id\f[R] in the config.

Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R]
.PP
put.io paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.SS Configuration
.PP
The initial setup for put.io involves getting a token from put.io which
you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 rclone config
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will guide you through an interactive setup process:
.IP

.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[R] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use
manual mode.

.SS Limitations
.PP
put.io has rate limiting.
When you hit a limit, rclone automatically retries after waiting the
amount of time requested by the server.
.PP
If you want to avoid ever hitting these limits, you may use the
\f[C]--tpslimit\f[R] flag with a low number.
Note that the imposed limits may be different for different operations,
and may change over time.
.SH Seafile
.PP
This is a backend for the Seafile (https://www.seafile.com/) storage
service: - It works with both the free community edition or the
professional edition.
- Seafile versions 6.x and 7.x are all supported.
- Encrypted libraries are also supported.
- It supports 2FA enabled users
.SS Configuration
.PP
There are two distinct modes you can setup your remote: - you point your
remote to the \f[B]root of the server\f[R], meaning you don\[aq]t
specify a library during the configuration: Paths are specified as
\f[C]remote:library\f[R].
You may put subdirectories in too, e.g.
\f[C]remote:library/path/to/dir\f[R].
- you point your remote to a specific library during the configuration:
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path/to/dir\f[R].
\f[B]This is the recommended mode when using encrypted libraries\f[R].
(\f[I]This mode is possibly slightly faster than the root mode\f[R])

.SH SFTP
.PP
SFTP is the Secure (or SSH) File Transfer
Protocol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).
.PP
The SFTP backend can be used with a number of different providers:
.IP \[bu] 2
rsync.net
.PP
SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern SSH
installations.
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[R].
If the path does not begin with a \f[C]/\f[R] it is relative to the home
directory of the user.
An empty path \f[C]remote:\f[R] refers to the user\[aq]s home directory.
For example, \f[C]rclone lsd remote:\f[R] would list the home directory
of the user cofigured in the rclone remote config
(\f[C]i.e /home/sftpuser\f[R]).
However, \f[C]rclone lsd remote:/\f[R] would list the root directory for
remote machine (i.e.
\f[C]/\f[R])
.PP
Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading / - Synology is a good
example of this.
rsync.net, on the other hand, requires users to OMIT the leading /.
.SS Configuration

Here is an example of making an SFTP configuration.

\f[C]/mnt/www-data\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone mount remote:/srv/www-data/ /mnt/www-data
\f[R]
.fi
.SS SSH Authentication
.PP
The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:
.IP \[bu] 2
Password
.IP \[bu] 2
Key file, including certificate signed keys
.IP \[bu] 2
ssh-agent
.PP
Key files should be PEM-encoded private key files.
For instance \f[C]/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa\f[R].
Only unencrypted OpenSSH or PEM encrypted files are supported.
.PP
The key file can be specified in either an external file (key_file) or
contained within the rclone config file (key_pem).
If using key_pem in the config file, the entry should be on a single
line with new line (\[aq]\[aq] or \[aq]\[aq]) separating lines.
i.e.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
key_pem = -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\[rs]nMaMbaIXtE\[rs]n0gAMbMbaSsd\[rs]nMbaass\[rs]n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will generate it correctly for key_pem for use in the config:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
awk \[aq]{printf \[dq]%s\[rs]\[rs]n\[dq], $0}\[aq] < \[ti]/.ssh/id_rsa
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you don\[aq]t specify \f[C]pass\f[R], \f[C]key_file\f[R], or
\f[C]key_pem\f[R] or \f[C]ask_password\f[R] then rclone will attempt to
contact an ssh-agent.
You can also specify \f[C]key_use_agent\f[R] to force the usage of an
ssh-agent.
In this case \f[C]key_file\f[R] or \f[C]key_pem\f[R] can also be
specified to force the usage of a specific key in the ssh-agent.
.PP
Using an ssh-agent is the only way to load encrypted OpenSSH keys at the
moment.
.PP
If you set the \f[C]ask_password\f[R] option, rclone will prompt for a
password when needed and no password has been configured.
.SS Certificate-signed keys
.PP
With traditional key-based authentication, you configure your private
key only, and the public key built into it will be used during the
authentication process.
.PP
If you have a certificate you may use it to sign your public key,
creating a separate SSH user certificate that should be used instead of
the plain public key extracted from the private key.
Then you must provide the path to the user certificate public key file
in \f[C]pubkey_file\f[R].
.PP
Note: This is not the traditional public key paired with your private
key, typically saved as \f[C]/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\f[R].
Setting this path in \f[C]pubkey_file\f[R] will not work.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
key_file = \[ti]/id_rsa
pubkey_file = \[ti]/id_rsa-cert.pub
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you concatenate a cert with a private key then you can specify the
merged file in both places.
.PP
Note: the cert must come first in the file.
e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cat id_rsa-cert.pub id_rsa > merged_key

.SS Host key validation
.PP
By default rclone will not check the server\[aq]s host key for
validation.
This can allow an attacker to replace a server with their own and if you
use password authentication then this can lead to that password being
exposed.
.PP
Host key matching, using standard \f[C]known_hosts\f[R] files can be
turned on by enabling the \f[C]known_hosts_file\f[R] option.
This can point to the file maintained by \f[C]OpenSSH\f[R] or can point
to a unique file.
.PP
e.g.
using the OpenSSH \f[C]known_hosts\f[R] file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
pass = 
known_hosts_file = \[ti]/.ssh/known_hosts
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Alternatively you can create your own known hosts file like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
ssh-keyscan -t dsa,rsa,ecdsa,ed25519 example.com >> known_hosts
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
There are some limitations:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]rclone\f[R] will not \f[I]manage\f[R] this file for you.
If the key is missing or wrong then the connection will be refused.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the server is set up for a certificate host key then the entry in the
\f[C]known_hosts\f[R] file \f[I]must\f[R] be the
\f[C]\[at]cert-authority\f[R] entry for the CA
.PP
If the host key provided by the server does not match the one in the
file (or is missing) then the connection will be aborted and an error
returned such as
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
NewFs: couldn\[aq]t connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key mismatch
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
NewFs: couldn\[aq]t connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key is unknown
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you see an error such as
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
NewFs: couldn\[aq]t connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: no authorities for hostname: example.com:22
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
then it is likely the server has presented a CA signed host certificate
and you will need to add the appropriate \f[C]\[at]cert-authority\f[R]
entry.
.PP
The \f[C]known_hosts_file\f[R] setting can be set during
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] as an advanced option.
.SS ssh-agent on macOS
.PP
Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS.
The most effective work-around seems to be to start an ssh-agent in each
session, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval \[ga]ssh-agent -s\[ga] && ssh-add -A
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And then at the end of the session
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval \[ga]ssh-agent -k\[ga]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
These commands can be used in scripts of course.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.
.PP
Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.
.PP
Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time
after upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with
mod_sftp).
If you are using one of these servers, you can set the option
\f[C]set_modtime = false\f[R] in your RClone backend configuration to
disable this behaviour.

.SS Limitations
.PP
SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and
\f[C]md5sum\f[R] or \f[C]sha1sum\f[R] as well as \f[C]echo\f[R] are in
the remote\[aq]s PATH.
This remote checksumming (file hashing) is recommended and enabled by
default.
Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP
servers which are not under your control, and to which the execution of
remote commands is prohibited.
Set the configuration option \f[C]disable_hashcheck\f[R] to
\f[C]true\f[R] to disable checksumming.
.PP
SFTP also supports \f[C]about\f[R] if the same login has shell access
and \f[C]df\f[R] are in the remote\[aq]s PATH.
\f[C]about\f[R] will return the total space, free space, and used space
on the remote for the disk of the specified path on the remote or, if
not set, the disk of the root on the remote.
\f[C]about\f[R] will fail if it does not have shell access or if
\f[C]df\f[R] is not in the remote\[aq]s PATH.
.PP
Note that some SFTP servers (e.g.
Synology) the paths are different for SSH and SFTP so the hashes
can\[aq]t be calculated properly.
For them using \f[C]disable_hashcheck\f[R] is a good idea.
.PP
The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty\[aq]s pageant.
.PP
The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher by default,
due to security concerns.
This can be re-enabled on a per-connection basis by setting the
\f[C]use_insecure_cipher\f[R] setting in the configuration file to
\f[C]true\f[R].
Further details on the insecurity of this cipher can be found in this
paper (http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/SandPfinal.pdf).
.PP
SFTP isn\[aq]t supported under plan9 until this
issue (https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/156) is fixed.

Note that since SFTP isn\[aq]t HTTP based the following flags don\[aq]t
work with it: \f[C]--dump-headers\f[R], \f[C]--dump-bodies\f[R],

.SH Storj
.PP
Storj (https://storj.io) is an encrypted, secure, and cost-effective
object storage service that enables you to store, back up, and archive
large amounts of data in a decentralized manner.
.SS Backend options
.PP
Storj can be used both with this native backend and with the s3 backend
using the Storj S3 compatible gateway (https://rclone.org/s3/#storj)
(shared or private).
.PP
Use this backend to take advantage of client-side encryption as well as
to achieve the best possible download performance.
Uploads will be erasure-coded locally, thus a 1gb upload will result in
2.68gb of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.
.PP
Use the s3 backend and one of the S3 compatible Hosted Gateways to
increase upload performance and reduce the load on your systems and
network.
Uploads will be encrypted and erasure-coded server-side, thus a 1GB
upload will result in only in 1GB of data being uploaded to storage
nodes across the network.

.SS Limitations
.PP
\f[C]rclone about\f[R] is not supported by the rclone Storj backend.
Backends without this capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount or use policy \f[C]mfs\f[R] (most free space) as a member
of an rclone union remote.
.PP
See List of backends that do not support rclone
about (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) See rclone
about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
.SS Known issues
.PP
If you get errors like \f[C]too many open files\f[R] this usually
happens when the default \f[C]ulimit\f[R] for system max open files is
exceeded.
Native Storj protocol opens a large number of TCP connections (each of
which is counted as an open file).
For a single upload stream you can expect 110 TCP connections to be
opened.
For a single download stream you can expect 35.
This batch of connections will be opened for every 64 MiB segment and
you should also expect TCP connections to be reused.
If you do many transfers you eventually open a connection to most
storage nodes (thousands of nodes).
.PP
To fix these, please raise your system limits.
You can do this issuing a \f[C]ulimit -n 65536\f[R] just before you run
rclone.
To change the limits more permanently you can add this to your shell
startup script, e.g.
\f[C]$HOME/.bashrc\f[R], or change the system-wide configuration,
usually \f[C]/etc/sysctl.conf\f[R] and/or
\f[C]/etc/security/limits.conf\f[R], but please refer to your operating
system manual.
.SH SugarSync
.PP
SugarSync (https://sugarsync.com) is a cloud service that enables active
synchronization of files across computers and other devices for file
backup, access, syncing, and sharing.
.SS Configuration
.PP
The initial setup for SugarSync involves getting a token from SugarSync
which you can do with rclone.
\f[C]rclone config\f[R] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[R].

.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] you can\[aq]t create files in the top level folder you have
to create a folder, which rclone will create as a \[dq]Sync Folder\[dq]
with SugarSync.
.SS Modified time and hashes
.PP
SugarSync does not support modification times or hashes, therefore
syncing will default to \f[C]--size-only\f[R] checking.
Note that using \f[C]--update\f[R] will work as rclone can read the time
files were uploaded.
.SS Restricted filename characters
.PP
SugarSync replaces the default restricted characters
set (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters) except for DEL.
.PP
Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be used in XML strings.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Deleted files will be moved to the \[dq]Deleted items\[dq] folder by
default.
.PP
However you can supply the flag \f[C]--sugarsync-hard-delete\f[R] or set
the config parameter \f[C]hard_delete = true\f[R] if you would like
files to be deleted straight away.

.PP
Here are the advanced options specific to uptobox (Uptobox).
.SS --uptobox-encoding

.SS Limitations
.PP
Uptobox will delete inactive files that have not been accessed in 60
days.
.PP
\f[C]rclone about\f[R] is not supported by this backend an overview of
used space can however been seen in the uptobox web interface.
.SH Union
.PP
The \f[C]union\f[R] remote provides a unification similar to UnionFS
using other remotes.
.PP
Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, e.g.
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[R] or
\f[C]/directory/subdirectory\f[R].
.PP
During the initial setup with \f[C]rclone config\f[R] you will specify
the upstream remotes as a space separated list.
The upstream remotes can either be a local paths or other remotes.
.PP
Attribute \f[C]:ro\f[R] and \f[C]:nc\f[R] can be attach to the end of
path to tag the remote as \f[B]read only\f[R] or \f[B]no create\f[R],
e.g.
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory:ro\f[R] or
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory:nc\f[R].
.PP
Subfolders can be used in upstream remotes.
Assume a union remote named \f[C]backup\f[R] with the remotes
\f[C]mydrive:private/backup\f[R].
Invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir backup:desktop\f[R] is exactly the same as
invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop\f[R].
.PP
There will be no special handling of paths containing \f[C]..\f[R]
segments.
Invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir backup:../desktop\f[R] is exactly the same as
invoking \f[C]rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop\f[R].
.SS Configuration
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a union called \f[C]remote\f[R] for
local folders.
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 rclone config
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will guide you through an interactive setup process:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.PP
Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[R] like this,
.PP
List directories in top level in \f[C]remote1:dir1\f[R],
\f[C]remote2:dir2\f[R] and \f[C]remote3:dir3\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
List all the files in \f[C]remote1:dir1\f[R], \f[C]remote2:dir2\f[R] and
\f[C]remote3:dir3\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Copy another local directory to the union directory called source, which
will be placed into \f[C]remote3:dir3\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy C:\[rs]source remote:source
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Behavior / Policies
.PP
The behavior of union backend is inspired by
trapexit/mergerfs (https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs).
All functions are grouped into 3 categories: \f[B]action\f[R],
\f[B]create\f[R] and \f[B]search\f[R].
These functions and categories can be assigned a policy which dictates
what file or directory is chosen when performing that behavior.
Any policy can be assigned to a function or category though some may not
be very useful in practice.
For instance: \f[B]rand\f[R] (random) may be useful for file creation
(create) but could lead to very odd behavior if used for
\f[C]delete\f[R] if there were more than one copy of the file.

.SS Path Preservation
.PP
Policies, as described below, are of two basic types.
\f[C]path preserving\f[R] and \f[C]non-path preserving\f[R].
.PP
All policies which start with \f[C]ep\f[R] (\f[B]epff\f[R],
\f[B]eplfs\f[R], \f[B]eplus\f[R], \f[B]epmfs\f[R], \f[B]eprand\f[R]) are
\f[C]path preserving\f[R].
\f[C]ep\f[R] stands for \f[C]existing path\f[R].
.PP
A path preserving policy will only consider upstreams where the relative
path being accessed already exists.
.PP
When using non-path preserving policies paths will be created in target
upstreams as necessary.
.SS Quota Relevant Policies
.PP
Some policies rely on quota information.
These policies should be used only if your upstreams support the
respective quota fields.

.PP
To check if your upstream supports the field, run
\f[C]rclone about remote: [flags]\f[R] and see if the required field
exists.
.SS Filters
.PP
Policies basically search upstream remotes and create a list of files /
paths for functions to work on.
The policy is responsible for filtering and sorting.
The policy type defines the sorting but filtering is mostly uniform as
described below.
.IP \[bu] 2
No \f[B]search\f[R] policies filter.
.IP \[bu] 2
All \f[B]action\f[R] policies will filter out remotes which are tagged
as \f[B]read-only\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
All \f[B]create\f[R] policies will filter out remotes which are tagged
\f[B]read-only\f[R] or \f[B]no-create\f[R].
.PP
If all remotes are filtered an error will be returned.
.SS Policy descriptions
.PP
The policies definition are inspired by
trapexit/mergerfs (https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs) but not exactly
the same.
Some policy definition could be different due to the much larger latency
of remote file systems.

Click on the settings cog in the bottom right of the page and this will
show the WebDAV URL that rclone needs in the config step.
It will look something like
\f[C]https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/\f[R].
.PP
Owncloud supports modified times using the \f[C]X-OC-Mtime\f[R] header.
.SS Nextcloud
.PP
This is configured in an identical way to Owncloud.
Note that Nextcloud initially did not support streaming of files
(\f[C]rcat\f[R]) whereas Owncloud did, but
this (https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap/issues/365) seems to
be fixed as of 2020-11-27 (tested with rclone v1.53.1 and Nextcloud
Server v19).
.SS Sharepoint Online
.PP
Rclone can be used with Sharepoint provided by OneDrive for Business or
Office365 Education Accounts.
This feature is only needed for a few of these Accounts, mostly
Office365 Education ones.
These accounts are sometimes not verified by the domain owner
github#1975 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1975)
.PP
This means that these accounts can\[aq]t be added using the official API
(other Accounts should work with the \[dq]onedrive\[dq] option).
However, it is possible to access them using webdav.
.PP
To use a sharepoint remote with rclone, add it like this: First, you
need to get your remote\[aq]s URL:
.IP \[bu] 2
Go here (https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/) to open your
OneDrive or to sign in
.IP \[bu] 2
Now take a look at your address bar, the URL should look like this:
\f[C]https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx\f[R]
.PP
You\[aq]ll only need this URL up to the email address.
After that, you\[aq]ll most likely want to add \[dq]/Documents\[dq].
That subdirectory contains the actual data stored on your OneDrive.
.PP
Add the remote to rclone like this: Configure the \f[C]url\f[R] as
\f[C]https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents\f[R]
and use your normal account email and password for \f[C]user\f[R] and
\f[C]pass\f[R].
If you have 2FA enabled, you have to generate an app password.
Set the \f[C]vendor\f[R] to \f[C]sharepoint\f[R].
.PP
Your config file should look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[sharepoint]
type = webdav
url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents
vendor = sharepoint
user = YourEmailAddress
pass = encryptedpassword
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Sharepoint with NTLM Authentication
.PP
Use this option in case your (hosted) Sharepoint is not tied to OneDrive
accounts and uses NTLM authentication.
.PP
To get the \f[C]url\f[R] configuration, similarly to the above, first
navigate to the desired directory in your browser to get the URL, then
strip everything after the name of the opened directory.
.PP
Example: If the URL is:
https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx
.PP
The configuration to use would be:
https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents
.PP
Set the \f[C]vendor\f[R] to \f[C]sharepoint-ntlm\f[R].
.PP
NTLM uses domain and user name combination for authentication, set
\f[C]user\f[R] to \f[C]DOMAIN\[rs]username\f[R].
.PP
Your config file should look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.SS Required Flags for SharePoint
.PP
As SharePoint does some special things with uploaded documents, you
won\[aq]t be able to use the documents size or the documents hash to
compare if a file has been changed since the upload / which file is
newer.
.PP
For Rclone calls copying files (especially Office files such as .docx,
\&.xlsx, etc.) from/to SharePoint (like copy, sync, etc.), you should
append these flags to ensure Rclone uses the \[dq]Last Modified\[dq]
datetime property to compare your documents:

.SS dCache
.PP
dCache is a storage system that supports many protocols and
authentication/authorisation schemes.
For WebDAV clients, it allows users to authenticate with username and
password (BASIC), X.509, Kerberos, and various bearer tokens, including
Macaroons (https://www.dcache.org/manuals/workshop-2017-05-29-Umea/000-Final/anupam_macaroons_v02.pdf)
and OpenID-Connect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) access
tokens.
.PP
Configure as normal using the \f[C]other\f[R] type.
Don\[aq]t enter a username or password, instead enter your Macaroon as
the \f[C]bearer_token\f[R].
.PP
The config will end up looking something like this.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[dcache]
type = webdav
url = https://dcache...
vendor = other
user =
pass =
bearer_token = your-macaroon
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
There is a
script (https://github.com/sara-nl/GridScripts/blob/master/get-macaroon)
that obtains a Macaroon from a dCache WebDAV endpoint, and creates an
rclone config file.
.PP
Macaroons may also be obtained from the dCacheView
web-browser/JavaScript client that comes with dCache.
.SS OpenID-Connect
.PP
dCache also supports authenticating with OpenID-Connect access tokens.
OpenID-Connect is a protocol (based on OAuth 2.0) that allows services
to identify users who have authenticated with some central service.
.PP
Support for OpenID-Connect in rclone is currently achieved using another
software package called
oidc-agent (https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent).
This is a command-line tool that facilitates obtaining an access token.
Once installed and configured, an access token is obtained by running
the \f[C]oidc-token\f[R] command.
The following example shows a (shortened) access token obtained from the
\f[I]XDC\f[R] OIDC Provider.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
paul\[at]celebrimbor:\[ti]$ oidc-token XDC
eyJraWQ[...]QFXDt0
paul\[at]celebrimbor:\[ti]$
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R] Before the \f[C]oidc-token\f[R] command will work, the
refresh token must be loaded into the oidc agent.
This is done with the \f[C]oidc-add\f[R] command (e.g.,
\f[C]oidc-add XDC\f[R]).
This is typically done once per login session.
Full details on this and how to register oidc-agent with your OIDC
Provider are provided in the oidc-agent
documentation (https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/).
.PP
The rclone \f[C]bearer_token_command\f[R] configuration option is used
to fetch the access token from oidc-agent.
.PP
Configure as a normal WebDAV endpoint, using the \[aq]other\[aq] vendor,
leaving the username and password empty.
When prompted, choose to edit the advanced config and enter the command
to get a bearer token (e.g., \f[C]oidc-agent XDC\f[R]).
.PP
The following example config shows a WebDAV endpoint that uses
oidc-agent to supply an access token from the \f[I]XDC\f[R] OIDC
Provider.

.SS Limitations
.PP
When uploading very large files (bigger than about 5 GiB) you will need
to increase the \f[C]--timeout\f[R] parameter.
This is because Yandex pauses (perhaps to calculate the MD5SUM for the
entire file) before returning confirmation that the file has been
uploaded.
The default handling of timeouts in rclone is to assume a 5 minute pause
is an error and close the connection - you\[aq]ll see
\f[C]net/http: timeout awaiting response headers\f[R] errors in the logs
if this is happening.
Setting the timeout to twice the max size of file in GiB should be
enough, so if you want to upload a 30 GiB file set a timeout of
\f[C]2 * 30 = 60m\f[R], that is \f[C]--timeout 60m\f[R].

Having a Yandex Mail account is mandatory to use the Yandex.Disk
subscription.

.fi
.PP
Will sync \f[C]/home/source\f[R] to \f[C]/tmp/destination\f[R].
.SS Configuration
.PP
For consistencies sake one can also configure a remote of type
\f[C]local\f[R] in the config file, and access the local filesystem
using rclone remote paths, e.g.
\f[C]remote:path/to/wherever\f[R], but it is probably easier not to.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined
by the OS.
Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second on OS X.
.SS Filenames
.PP
Filenames should be encoded in UTF-8 on disk.
This is the normal case for Windows and OS X.
.PP
There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF-8 encoded files names.
If you are using an old Linux filesystem with non UTF-8 file names (e.g.
latin1) then you can use the \f[C]convmv\f[R] tool to convert the
filesystem to UTF-8.
This tool is available in most distributions\[aq] package managers.
.PP
If an invalid (non-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid characters will
be replaced with a quoted representation of the invalid bytes.
The name \f[C]gro\[rs]xdf\f[R] will be transferred as
\f[C]gro\[u201B]DF\f[R].
\f[C]rclone\f[R] will emit a debug message in this case (use
\f[C]-v\f[R] to see), e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Local file system at .: Replacing invalid UTF-8 characters in \[dq]gro\[rs]xdf\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Restricted characters
.PP
With the local backend, restrictions on the characters that are usable
in file or directory names depend on the operating system.
To check what rclone will replace by default on your system, run
\f[C]rclone help flags local-encoding\f[R].

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be
replaced (https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as they can\[aq]t
be converted to UTF-16.
.SS Paths on Windows
.PP
On Windows there are many ways of specifying a path to a file system
resource.
Local paths can be absolute, like
\f[C]C:\[rs]path\[rs]to\[rs]wherever\f[R], or relative, like
\f[C]..\[rs]wherever\f[R].
Network paths in UNC format, \f[C]\[rs]\[rs]server\[rs]share\f[R], are
also supported.
Path separator can be either \f[C]\[rs]\f[R] (as in
\f[C]C:\[rs]path\[rs]to\[rs]wherever\f[R]) or \f[C]/\f[R] (as in
\f[C]C:/path/to/wherever\f[R]).
Length of these paths are limited to 259 characters for files and 247
characters for directories, but there is an alternative extended-length
path format increasing the limit to (approximately) 32,767 characters.
This format requires absolute paths and the use of prefix
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]?\[rs]\f[R], e.g.
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]?\[rs]D:\[rs]some\[rs]very\[rs]long\[rs]path\f[R].
For convenience rclone will automatically convert regular paths into the
corresponding extended-length paths, so in most cases you do not have to
worry about this (read more below).
.PP
Note that Windows supports using the same prefix
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]?\[rs]\f[R] to specify path to volumes identified by
their GUID, e.g.
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]?\[rs]Volume{b75e2c83-0000-0000-0000-602f00000000}\[rs]some\[rs]path\f[R].
This is \f[I]not\f[R] supported in rclone, due to an
issue (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39785) in go.
.SS Long paths
.PP
Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to
extended-length path
format (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation),
which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.
.PP
This conversion will ensure paths are absolute and prefix them with the
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]?\[rs]\f[R].
This is why you will see that your paths, for instance
\f[C].\[rs]files\f[R] is shown as path
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]?\[rs]C:\[rs]files\f[R] in the output, and
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]server\[rs]share\f[R] as
\f[C]\[rs]\[rs]?\[rs]UNC\[rs]server\[rs]share\f[R].
.PP
However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file system
drivers like EncFS (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/261).
To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your
\f[C].rclone.conf\f[R] file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[local]
nounc = true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate
entry like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[nounc]
type = local
nounc = true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And use rclone like this:
.PP
\f[C]rclone copy c:\[rs]src nounc:z:\[rs]dst\f[R]
.PP
This will use UNC paths on \f[C]c:\[rs]src\f[R] but not on
\f[C]z:\[rs]dst\f[R].
Of course this will cause problems if the absolute path length of a file
exceeds 259 characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.
.SS Symlinks / Junction points
.PP
Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).
.PP
If you supply \f[C]--copy-links\f[R] or \f[C]-L\f[R] then rclone will
follow the symlink and copy the pointed to file or directory.
Note that this flag is incompatible with \f[C]--links\f[R] /
\f[C]-l\f[R].
.PP
This flag applies to all commands.
.PP
For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] b -> ../b
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] expected -> ../expected
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] one
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] two
    \[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] three
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then you can see the difference with and without the flag like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone ls /tmp/a
        6 one
        6 two/three
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
and
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone -L ls /tmp/a
     4174 expected
        6 one
        6 two/three
        6 b/two
        6 b/one
\f[R]
.fi
.SS --links, -l
.PP
Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).
.PP
If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from the
local storage, and store them as text files, with a
\[aq].rclonelink\[aq] suffix in the remote storage.
.PP
The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link (see
example).
.PP
This flag applies to all commands.
.PP
For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] file1 -> ./file4
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file2 -> /home/user/file3
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Copying the entire directory with \[aq]-l\[aq]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone copyto -l /tmp/a/file1 remote:/tmp/a/
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The remote files are created with a \[aq].rclonelink\[aq] suffix
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone ls remote:/tmp/a
       5 file1.rclonelink
      14 file2.rclonelink
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The remote files will contain the target of the symbolic links
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink
\&./file4

$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file2.rclonelink
/home/user/file3
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Copying them back with \[aq]-l\[aq]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone copyto -l remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] file1 -> ./file4
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file2 -> /home/user/file3
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, if copied back without \[aq]-l\[aq]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone copyto remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] file1.rclonelink
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file2.rclonelink
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that this flag is incompatible with \f[C]-copy-links\f[R] /
\f[C]-L\f[R].
.SS Restricting filesystems with --one-file-system
.PP
Normally rclone will recurse through filesystems as mounted.
.PP
However if you set \f[C]--one-file-system\f[R] or \f[C]-x\f[R] this
tells rclone to stay in the filesystem specified by the root and not to
recurse into different file systems.
.PP
For example if you have a directory hierarchy like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
root
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] disk1     - disk1 mounted on the root
\[br]\ \  \[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file3 - stored on disk1
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] disk2     - disk2 mounted on the root
\[br]\ \  \[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file4 - stored on disk12
\[u251C]\[u2500]\[u2500] file1     - stored on the root disk
\[u2514]\[u2500]\[u2500] file2     - stored on the root disk
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Using \f[C]rclone --one-file-system copy root remote:\f[R] will only
copy \f[C]file1\f[R] and \f[C]file2\f[R].
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone -q --one-file-system ls root
        0 file1
        0 file2
\f[R]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone -q ls root
        0 disk1/file3
        0 disk2/file4
        0 file1
        0 file2
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] Rclone (like most unix tools such as \f[C]du\f[R],
\f[C]rsync\f[R] and \f[C]tar\f[R]) treats a bind mount to the same
device as being on the same filesystem.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] This flag is only available on Unix based systems.
On systems where it isn\[aq]t supported (e.g.
Windows) it will be ignored.

.SS --local-zero-size-links
.PP
Assume the Stat size of links is zero (and read them instead)
(deprecated).
.PP
Rclone used to use the Stat size of links as the link size, but this
fails in quite a few places:
.IP \[bu] 2
Windows
.IP \[bu] 2
On some virtual filesystems (such ash LucidLink)
.IP \[bu] 2
Android
.PP
So rclone now always reads the link.

Default: false
.SS --local-unicode-normalization
.PP
Apply unicode NFC normalization to paths and filenames.
.PP
This flag can be used to normalize file names into unicode NFC form that
are read from the local filesystem.
.PP
Rclone does not normally touch the encoding of file names it reads from
the file system.
.PP
This can be useful when using macOS as it normally provides decomposed
(NFD) unicode which in some language (eg Korean) doesn\[aq]t display
properly on some OSes.
.PP
Note that rclone compares filenames with unicode normalization in the
sync routine so this flag shouldn\[aq]t normally be used.
.PP
Properties:
.IP \[bu] 2
Config: unicode_normalization
.IP \[bu] 2
Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_UNICODE_NORMALIZATION
.IP \[bu] 2
Type: bool
.IP \[bu] 2
Default: false
.SS --local-no-check-updated
.PP
Don\[aq]t check to see if the files change during upload.
.PP
Normally rclone checks the size and modification time of files as they
are being uploaded and aborts with a message which starts \[dq]can\[aq]t
copy - source file is being updated\[dq] if the file changes during
upload.
.PP
However on some file systems this modification time check may fail (e.g.
Glusterfs #2206 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2206)) so this
check can be disabled with this flag.
.PP
If this flag is set, rclone will use its best efforts to transfer a file
which is being updated.
If the file is only having things appended to it (e.g.
a log) then rclone will transfer the log file with the size it had the
first time rclone saw it.
.PP
If the file is being modified throughout (not just appended to) then the
transfer may fail with a hash check failure.
.PP
In detail, once the file has had stat() called on it for the first time
we:
.IP \[bu] 2
Only transfer the size that stat gave
.IP \[bu] 2
Only checksum the size that stat gave
.IP \[bu] 2
Don\[aq]t update the stat info for the file
.PP

.SS --local-no-preallocate
.PP
Disable preallocation of disk space for transferred files.
.PP
Preallocation of disk space helps prevent filesystem fragmentation.
However, some virtual filesystem layers (such as Google Drive File
Stream) may incorrectly set the actual file size equal to the
preallocated space, causing checksum and file size checks to fail.
Use this flag to disable preallocation.
.PP

.SS --local-no-sparse
.PP
Disable sparse files for multi-thread downloads.
.PP
On Windows platforms rclone will make sparse files when doing
multi-thread downloads.
This avoids long pauses on large files where the OS zeros the file.
However sparse files may be undesirable as they cause disk fragmentation
and can be slow to work with.
.PP

.SS --local-no-set-modtime
.PP
Disable setting modtime.
.PP
Normally rclone updates modification time of files after they are done
uploading.
This can cause permissions issues on Linux platforms when the user
rclone is running as does not own the file uploaded, such as when
copying to a CIFS mount owned by another user.
If this option is enabled, rclone will no longer update the modtime
after copying a file.

.SH Bugs and Limitations
.SS Limitations
.SS Directory timestamps aren\[aq]t preserved
.PP
Rclone doesn\[aq]t currently preserve the timestamps of directories.
This is because rclone only really considers objects when syncing.
.SS Rclone struggles with millions of files in a directory/bucket
.PP
Currently rclone loads each directory/bucket entirely into memory before
using it.
Since each rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory this can take a very
long time and use a large amount of memory.
.PP
Millions of files in a directory tends to occur on bucket-based remotes
(e.g.
S3 buckets) since those remotes do not segregate subdirectories within
the bucket.
.SS Bucket-based remotes and folders
.PP
Bucket-based remotes (e.g.
S3/GCS/Swift/B2) do not have a concept of directories.
Rclone therefore cannot create directories in them which means that
empty directories on a bucket-based remote will tend to disappear.
.PP
Some software creates empty keys ending in \f[C]/\f[R] as directory
markers.
Rclone doesn\[aq]t do this as it potentially creates more objects and
costs more.
This ability may be added in the future (probably via a flag/option).

.SH Frequently Asked Questions
.SS Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands
.PP
Yes they do.
All the rclone commands (e.g.
\f[C]sync\f[R], \f[C]copy\f[R], etc.) will work on all the remote
storage systems.
.SS Can I copy the config from one machine to another
.PP
Sure! Rclone stores all of its config in a single file.
If you want to find this file, run \f[C]rclone config file\f[R] which
will tell you where it is.
.PP
See the remote setup docs (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for more
info.
.SS How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no browser?
.PP
This has now been documented in its own remote setup
page (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/).
.SS Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3
.PP
Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.
.PP
Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so the
node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.
.PP
The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync -i drive:Folder s3:bucket
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time
.PP
You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server A> rclone sync -i /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA
Server B> rclone sync -i /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two instances of rclone may delete each other\[aq]s files,
e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server A> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
Server B> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different
in this case, otherwise some file systems (e.g.
Drive) may make duplicates.
.SS Why doesn\[aq]t rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like rsync?
.PP
Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system.
This means that you can see the files you upload as expected using
alternative access methods (e.g.
using the Google Drive web interface).
There is a 1:1 mapping between files on your hard disk and objects
created in the cloud storage system.
.PP
Cloud storage systems (at least none I\[aq]ve come across yet) don\[aq]t
support partially uploading an object.
You can\[aq]t take an existing object, and change some bytes in the
middle of it.
.PP
It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the 1:1
mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.
.PP
All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work.
However to make this work efficiently this would require storing a
significant amount of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of
files to objects.
.SS Can rclone do bi-directional sync?
.PP
No, not at present.
rclone only does uni-directional sync from A -> B.
It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives - it just
requires writing the algorithm to do it.
.SS Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy?
.PP
Yes.
rclone will follow the standard environment variables for proxies,
similar to cURL and other programs.
.PP
In general the variables are called \f[C]http_proxy\f[R] (for services
reached over \f[C]http\f[R]) and \f[C]https_proxy\f[R] (for services
reached over \f[C]https\f[R]).
Most public services will be using \f[C]https\f[R], but you may wish to
set both.
.PP
The content of the variable is \f[C]protocol://server:port\f[R].
The protocol value is the one used to talk to the proxy server, itself,
and is commonly either \f[C]http\f[R] or \f[C]socks5\f[R].
.PP
Slightly annoyingly, there is no \f[I]standard\f[R] for the name; some
applications may use \f[C]http_proxy\f[R] but another one
\f[C]HTTP_PROXY\f[R].
The \f[C]Go\f[R] libraries used by \f[C]rclone\f[R] will try both
variations, but you may wish to set all possibilities.
So, on Linux, you may end up with code similar to
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export http_proxy=http://proxyserver:12345
export https_proxy=$http_proxy
export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
export HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[C]NO_PROXY\f[R] allows you to disable the proxy for specific
hosts.
Hosts must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts.
For instance \[dq]foo.com\[dq] also matches \[dq]bar.foo.com\[dq].
.PP
e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,my.host.name
export NO_PROXY=$no_proxy
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that the ftp backend does not support \f[C]ftp_proxy\f[R] yet.
.SS Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided error
.PP
This means that \f[C]rclone\f[R] can\[aq]t find the SSL root
certificates.
Likely you are running \f[C]rclone\f[R] on a NAS with a cut-down Linux
OS, or possibly on Solaris.
.PP
Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\[dq]/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\[dq], // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.
\[dq]/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt\[dq],   // Fedora/RHEL
\[dq]/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem\[dq],             // OpenSUSE
\[dq]/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem\[dq],            // OpenELEC
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
So doing something like this should fix the problem.
It also sets the time which is important for SSL to work properly.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs/
curl -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The two environment variables \f[C]SSL_CERT_FILE\f[R] and
\f[C]SSL_CERT_DIR\f[R], mentioned in the x509
package (https://godoc.org/crypto/x509), provide an additional way to
provide the SSL root certificates.
.PP
Note that you may need to add the \f[C]--insecure\f[R] option to the
\f[C]curl\f[R] command line if it doesn\[aq]t work without.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
curl --insecure -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented error
.PP
Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.
.PP
See the system requirements section in the go install
docs (https://golang.org/doc/install) for full details.
.SS All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip
.PP
This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn\[aq]t got the Microsoft Office suite installed.
The easiest way to fix is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft
Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later
versions\[aq] file formats
.SS tcp lookup some.domain.com no such host
.PP
This happens when rclone cannot resolve a domain.
Please check that your DNS setup is generally working, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# both should print a long list of possible IP addresses
dig www.googleapis.com          # resolve using your default DNS
dig www.googleapis.com \[at]8.8.8.8 # resolve with Google\[aq]s DNS server
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you are using \f[C]systemd-resolved\f[R] (default on Arch Linux),
ensure it is at version 233 or higher.
Previous releases contain a bug which causes not all domains to be
resolved properly.
.PP
Additionally with the \f[C]GODEBUG=netdns=\f[R] environment variable the
Go resolver decision can be influenced.
This also allows to resolve certain issues with DNS resolution.
See the name resolution section in the go
docs (https://golang.org/pkg/net/#hdr-Name_Resolution).
.SS The total size reported in the stats for a sync is wrong and keeps changing
.PP
It is likely you have more than 10,000 files that need to be synced.
By default, rclone only gets 10,000 files ahead in a sync so as not to
use up too much memory.
You can change this default with the
--max-backlog (https://rclone.org/docs/#max-backlog-n) flag.
.SS Rclone is using too much memory or appears to have a memory leak
.PP
Rclone is written in Go which uses a garbage collector.
The default settings for the garbage collector mean that it runs when
the heap size has doubled.
.PP
However it is possible to tune the garbage collector to use less memory
by setting GOGC (https://dave.cheney.net/tag/gogc) to a lower value, say
\f[C]export GOGC=20\f[R].
This will make the garbage collector work harder, reducing memory size
at the expense of CPU usage.
.PP
The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single
directory with thousands or millions of files in.
Rclone has to load this entirely into memory as rclone objects.
Each rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory.
.SS Rclone changes fullwidth Unicode punctuation marks in file names
.PP
For example: On a Windows system, you have a file with name
\f[C]Test\[uFF1A]1.jpg\f[R], where \f[C]\[uFF1A]\f[R] is the Unicode
fullwidth colon symbol.
When using rclone to copy this to your Google Drive, you will notice
that the file gets renamed to \f[C]Test:1.jpg\f[R], where \f[C]:\f[R] is
the regular (halfwidth) colon.
.PP
The reason for such renames is the way rclone handles different
restricted filenames (https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-filenames)
on different cloud storage systems.
It tries to avoid ambiguous file names as much and allow moving files
between many cloud storage systems transparently, by replacing invalid
characters with similar looking Unicode characters when transferring to
one storage system, and replacing back again when transferring to a
different storage system where the original characters are supported.
When the same Unicode characters are intentionally used in file names,
this replacement strategy leads to unwanted renames.
